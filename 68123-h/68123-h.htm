<h3 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A year</span> or two before the outbreak of the Franco Prussian
War a daring attempt was made upon the life of the
Emperor of Russia. He had been out shooting in the
neighbourhood of St. Petersburg, and was returning at
dusk in company with numerous friends and a large suite.
As the Royal carriage passed an isolated house on a
country road, which was bordered on each side by a dense
pine forest, a bomb was hurled from an upper window of
the house. Fortunately it did not strike the carriage, as
was intended, but, going over it, fell between the horses
of two of the Royal Guard. The horses were blown to
pieces, the riders were killed on the spot, and several other
men were more or less injured. For some minutes a panic
ensued. The Emperor’s driver whipped his horses into a
gallop, and everybody seemed at a loss what to do. The
house, however, was soon surrounded, and a man and
woman were seized as they were in the very act of escaping.
It was soon made evident that this man and woman were
mere tools, and the arch-conspirators had availed themselves
of the confusion caused by the bursting bomb to get
off. Darkness favoured the fugitives, and though the
forest was scoured they were not captured. Subsequent
investigation brought to light that the plot for the
Emperor’s taking off had been the work chiefly of a daring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
and notorious Nihilist, whose capture the Russian Government
had long been trying to effect. His connection with
this dastardly attempt caused a heavy price to be set upon
his head, and every effort was made to arrest him. But,
extraordinary as it seems, he succeeded in evading his
pursuers, and, after travelling many hundreds of miles
through the country in various disguises, he managed to
get on board of a vessel bound to Constantinople—so much
of his flight was subsequently learnt when it was too late;
but at Constantinople all trace of him was lost, though
there was reason to believe that he had escaped to either
France or England, and a large staff of the most able
Russian and Polish detectives were sent out to scour
Europe.</p>

<p>One winter night of that memorable year, I was on my
way from Paris to London viâ Calais. It had been a wild
and stormy day; a high wind, bitter cold, snow, sleet,
hail, rain—such were the atmospheric conditions. We
had had an assortment of the worst samples of weather,
and as night approached it was only too evident we were
in for ‘a buster.’ There were very few passengers by the
night train from Paris. It was not a night when anyone
was likely to be travelling for pleasure. On our reaching
Calais Station the wind had attained the force of a heavy
gale, causing a tremendous sea to run in the Channel, and
we who were pressed for time heard with dismay that the
boat was not likely to attempt the crossing before the
morning.</p>

<p>The cramped and starved passengers made a rush for the
buffet, but I had to see the guard of the train, owing to a
hand-bag of mine having gone astray. This bit of business
occupied me for quite twenty minutes, and then, almost
frozen to the marrow, I made my way to the buffet. The
large stove in the centre of the room was surrounded by
the passengers, so I seated myself at one of the long
tables and called for hot soup. It was not until I had
finished the steaming bouillon, and had begun to thaw,
that I became conscious I had a <i>vis-à-vis</i>. On the opposite
side of the table, on the carpeted settee in a corner next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
the wall, sat a man with his legs upon the settee, his arms
folded on his breast. The place was lighted by lamps.
The light was dim, and the man was in partial shadow;
but I noted that he wore a heavy fur coat, he had a peakless
fur cap on his head, and was puffing away at a long
and strong cigar. At his elbow on the table was a large
basin of tea, and floating in the tea were three or four
slices of lemon.</p>

<p>I really don’t know how it was that I was suddenly
attracted to this stranger. Some people may try to explain
it by saying it was animal magnetism, odic force, or
something of the kind. I shall offer no explanation myself;
I merely state the bare fact. My eyes having got accustomed
to the semi-gloom, I was enabled to observe that he
had a clean-shaven face, with a rather prominent nose, a
clean-cut mouth, which, taken in connection with the
formation of the chin and jaw generally, indicated an
iron will, a dogged determination. It was altogether
a very striking face, full of character, and with points
that removed it far from the category of the commonplace.</p>

<p>Having partaken of the rest of my supper, and feeling
more comfortable and cheerful, I lit a cigar, called for
coffee and a <i>petit verre</i>, assumed an easier position at the
end of the seat, so that I was enabled to lean my back
against the wall, my shoulders being thus parallel with the
stranger’s, the table separating us; then I spoke to him in
French—made some ordinary remarks about the weather,
and expressed a fear that we were doomed to pass the
night there in the buffet. He answered me very affably, and
in a rich, well-modulated voice. Fancying that I detected
a foreign accent in his French, I politely asked him if he
was a Frenchman. He smiled pleasantly, and expressed a
wish to know why I doubted his being French. I told him
frankly, whereupon he laughed again, and in perfect
English, except that it betrayed a foreign tongue in its
pronunciation, he said:</p>

<p>‘I guess <i>you</i> are an Englishman.’</p>

<p>I admitted that I was, and we chatted away first in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
French and then in English for a long time; we exchanged
cigars; he drank with me, I with him. Now, throughout
the conversation there was one thing I was conscious of—the
whole drift of his talk was to elicit information.
This was done so delicately and skilfully that the majority
of people would not have been aware of it. But I was.
It was part of my business to know when I was being
pumped, to use a vulgar but expressive phrase; I was also,
even as he was, a seeker after knowledge, and I fancy I
framed my questions perhaps not much less skilfully than
he. At any rate, we seemed to become <i>en rapport</i>, and it
is safe to say we interested each other. There was a
reciprocal attraction between us. After a time the conversation
flagged; tired nature was overcome, and we slept
where we sat. At about seven in the morning a porter
with stentorian lungs came in and aroused us from our
uneasy slumber by bawling out that we were all to get on
board the boat, as she was about to start. Confusion at
once reigned; there was a hasty gathering up of bags,
wraps, rugs, and other impedimenta, and a stampede was
made for the steamer, each man trying to be first, in order
that he might secure the best place in view of the stormy
passage we were likely to have. For myself, I went leisurely;
I was too case-hardened a traveller by land and sea to
concern myself even about the Channel in its anger. I
had, in the confusion, lost sight of my acquaintance of the
night, and for the moment had forgotten him, when
suddenly I heard his voice behind me. He had caught
me up.</p>

<p>‘You, like me, don’t give yourself much concern,’ he
remarked. ‘We shall have a rough crossing, no doubt,
but it doesn’t alarm me; I have been sodden with salt
water too often.’</p>

<p>This struck a keynote again; we passed on board. As
we reached the deck, he asked me if I was going below; I
said no, I preferred to remain on deck. So did he. We
therefore secured two camp-stools, placed them so that we
sat with our backs to the funnel for the sake of the warmth,
enveloped our knees in rugs, buttoned up our coats, battened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
our caps down, and made ourselves as snug as it was
possible to do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>It was a wild and wicked morning, and still very dark,
though in the far east there was an angry gleam of glary
light. The crossing was a rough one—as rough a one as I
ever remember to have experienced. When we reached
Dover we were all bedraggled and weary-looking, and
thankful indeed for the hot coffee that was served out to
us at the refreshment-bar. It was now broad daylight,
and for the first time I was enabled to distinctly see my
companion’s face. It was altogether a remarkable face. A
more pliable and mobile one I never saw. It never seemed
to be quite alike for five minutes at a time. His eyes were
small, but with, as it seemed, an almost unnatural brilliancy;
and there was a suggestiveness about them that they were
looking you through and through. His complexion was
olive; his eyes were black. In stature he was about the
middle height, with a well-knit frame. I noted that his
hands and wrists indicated great muscular strength. He
trod with a firm step; he walked upright; he was a man
whose presence asserted itself. None but a fool would be
likely to overlook him even in a crowd. There is one
other thing I must mention: his manner was that of an
exceedingly well-bred man; he was the pink of politeness.</p>

<p>The ‘something’—call it by what name you will—that
had drawn us together, kept us together, and we became
the sole occupants of a first-class compartment, in which
we journeyed to London. Long before our destination
was reached, I had made up my mind that my <i>compagnon
de voyage</i> was no ordinary man, and from certain things I
made a guess at his profession, and wishing to put my
opinion to the test, I alluded to the attempt that had been
made some time before on the Czar’s life. At this his
eyes transfixed me, as it were. Question and answer
followed, and at last, when I was sure that I should not
make any mistake, I led him to understand that my visit
to France had indirectly been in connection with the crime
in Russia. When we reached London, I found he was
going to stay at a hotel close to Trafalgar Square. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
gave him my card. He gave me his, which simply bore
the name</p>



<p class="center">MICHAEL DANEVITCH.</p>

<p>I knew then from the name that I had formed the acquaintance
of one of the foremost detectives in the world—a
man who had had more to do with unravelling political
crimes than any living being; and there was hardly a
civilized Government that had not, at some time or other,
availed itself of his services. He was endowed with wonderful
gifts, and having once got on to the track of a
criminal the criminal was to a certainty doomed. Danevitch’s
visit to England on this occasion was in connection
with the attempt on the Czar’s life. He ultimately succeeded
in unearthing one of the criminals in London, and
though the English Government would not give the rascal
up, Danevitch lured him to France by a wonderfully clever
ruse. There he was arrested; in due course the French
handed him over to Russia, and he expiated his wickedness
on the scaffold. The story of this thrilling capture will
be told in the course of this series. The acquaintance
which I struck up with Danevitch on that ever-to-be-remembered
night ripened into a very warm friendship,
which continued for many years. The result was he
promised me that if he predeceased me he would leave me
all his notes and papers that had any reference to his
professional career, and give me full permission to do what
I liked with them. Subsequently he was in a terrible
railway accident in Russia: the train by which he was
travelling came into collision with another train, and there
was an awful smash. Poor Danevitch was so injured that
both his legs had to be amputated. For several weeks he
seemed to be doing well, but a change took place, and he
realized that his fate was sealed. He sent for me, and
during the fortnight that passed after my arrival he told
me his history to a large extent, and handed me the
promised records of the extraordinary cases in which he
had played so important a part. It is from these records
that I now compile this series of stories.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF
A MILLION ROUBLES.</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening, towards the end of summer, four Government
officials left Moscow for St. Petersburg in charge of an
enormous amount of money, partly in specie, but for the
most part in Russian rouble notes. The money was consigned
to the Treasury in St. Petersburg. All the officials
had been in the Government service for a long time, and
were selected for this special duty on account of their
trustworthiness and the confidence reposed in them by the
heads of the department to which they belonged. The
oldest man, and the one in command of the little party,
was upwards of seventy years of age. He had been in
the Government service for forty years, and was greatly
trusted and respected. His name was Popoff. The next
in seniority was Ivan Basilovitch, who had been thirty-three
years in the service. Then came Strogonoff, with
twenty-eight years’ service, and lastly a young man named
Briazga, with ten years and a half to his credit in the
service of the Government. In addition to these four
Government officers, four gendarmes, fully armed, accompanied
the treasure as a guard of safety. The party
travelled by the ordinary train, but had a special saloon
carriage, the packages of money being placed at one end.
The only doors to the carriage were at the opposite end,
one on each side, the off-side door being locked by means
of a secret lock, which could not be opened except with
the proper key.</p>

<p>The bullion was carried in oak boxes fastened with iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
bands. The notes were in small square boxes, sewn up in
strong canvas. In addition they were securely corded with
fine but extraordinarily tough cord, which was made
especially for the Government, and could not be used
except for Government purposes. Every package bore
the State seal. Anyone unlawfully breaking the seal was
guilty, according to the law of Russia, of treason, and
liable to death or banishment to Siberia. In due course
the train reached St. Petersburg, where the packages of
money were examined, counted in the train, and found
correct. They were then loaded into a covered Government
waggon, counted and examined again, and also found
correct; and all being ready, the waggon drove off, accompanied
by the four officials and the gendarmes. At the
Treasury the packages were once again counted, examined,
and found correct, and the deputy of the Minister of Finance
himself gave the necessary receipt to the head-officer. The
important duty being thus completed, the gendarmes were
dismissed to their quarters, and the officers went to their
respective homes. In the course of the next day Danevitch
received a sudden command to attend without a moment’s
delay at the bureau of the chief of the police. He found
that important functionary looking very grave and serious,
and it was obvious he was disturbed by something of more
than ordinary importance. With official brevity he told
Danevitch about the money having been removed from
Moscow to St. Petersburg the previous night, and added:</p>

<p>‘This morning, in the presence of the Minister of
Finance himself and the official staff, the various packages
were opened. Two of the note boxes, although intact as
regards seals and cords, and which ought to have contained
five hundred thousand rouble notes each, were found to be
stuffed with blank paper. There has been some clever
hanky-panky business, and you are wanted at the Treasury
immediately. Now, it strikes me, Danevitch, that though
you’ve cracked some very hard nuts in your time, this one
will prove too much for you.’</p>

<p>‘Why do you think so?’</p>

<p>‘Why do I think so! Well, because the whole business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
has been managed so cleverly that the thieves have calculated
every chance, and are not likely to have left any
trail behind them that can be followed up. However, see
what you can do. You may succeed, but I’m afraid you
won’t.’</p>

<p>Danevitch made no comment on his chief’s remark, but
at once betook himself to the Treasury, where he found
everybody in a state of great excitement. He was at
once conducted into the presence of the Minister of
Finance, with whom he had a long interview, and from
whom he learnt all the details of the transit of the money.
Necessarily the detective sifted these details, examined
them one by one, and took such measures as occurred to
him to prove that they were absolutely correct. In the
end he was satisfied that they were. The Minister then
showed him a long telegram he had received from the
Treasury Office in Moscow, in which it was stated that the
money was packed in the usual way in the presence of the
cashier-in-chief, six of his subordinates, and a large staff,
all of them proved and tried servants. Every box was
numbered, registered, and sealed, and there was not the
shadow of a doubt that when the boxes left Moscow each
contained the full sum marked against it in the books of
the department. Danevitch saw at once that if that was
correct it proved that the robbery must have occurred in
transit, which obviously necessitated a prearranged plan
of a very ingenious nature; moreover, it pointed to the
confederacy of every man, including the gendarmes,
engaged in safe-guarding the treasure. It was difficult to
believe in such a conspiracy; but on the first blush it
seemed the only rational conclusion that one could come
to, otherwise the officers and the police must have been
culpably negligent of their duty to have allowed a stranger
to have walked off the boxes, leaving dummy facsimiles in
their place. However, Danevitch would express no opinion
then, although the Minister was anxious that he should do
so; but it was the detective’s invariable rule to keep his
opinions to himself until he was in a position to speak
with something like certainty. As he himself was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
habit of saying, he never prophesied until he knew. It
was a safe rule, and it saved him from many an error.</p>

<p>Having completed his investigations in St. Petersburg
so far as he could at that stage, he proceeded without loss
of time to Moscow, where he satisfied himself, from the evidence
laid before him, that the money really left the Moscow
Treasury all right; and it was impossible the boxes could
have been exchanged between the Treasury and the station.
The treasure was conveyed in a closed waggon, which was
locked and barred, and in its passage through the city it
was guarded by twelve mounted soldiers specially told off
for the duty. At the station the waggon was backed right
up to the railway-carriage, and was unpacked in the presence
of quite a little army of officials. Again, unless
there had been a huge conspiracy, the boxes could not
have been abstracted there. This narrowed the inquiry
somewhat, because it made it clear that the exchange must
have been effected while the train was on its journey
between the two cities. But admitting that to be the case,
it at once suggested that the eight men, that is, the four
officers and four gendarmes, were in league together. To
that, however, was opposed the fact that the gendarmes
were only told off for the duty an hour before they started,
and up to that time had had no intimation they were
going. Therefore, assuming the four clerks had prearranged
the matter, they must have corrupted the gendarmes
<i>en route</i>. That, however, was such a far-fetched
theory that Danevitch would not entertain it.</p>

<p>The next phase of inquiry upon which Danevitch
entered was that of ascertaining as much as possible about
the four Government officials who travelled in charge of
the treasure. These inquiries elicited the fact that they
bore irreproachable characters, and were held in high
esteem in the department. Popoff was a married man
with a family. He was in receipt of a good salary, and
appeared to be free from financial worries of any kind.
The same remarks applied to Basilovitch and Strogonoff.
They were both married and family men, and to all
appearances in comfortable circumstances. Briazga was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
unmarried, but he was regarded as a very steady, well-to-do
young fellow, and was known to be the main support of
his father, mother, and an only sister, whose name was
Olga. She was younger than her brother, and, owing to
an injury to the spine when she was a child, she had been
more or less an invalid all her life.</p>

<p>Danevitch realized at this stage, even as the chief of the
police predicted he would, that he was called upon to
crack a very hard nut indeed, and he did not feel confident
about being able to crack it at all. The minutest
investigation had failed so far to elicit anything that
would have justified a suspicion of a conspiracy amongst
the eight men. And yet without the connivance of them
all it seemed impossible that the boxes could have been
changed. But there was the indisputable fact that they
had been changed; nevertheless, there was not a single item
in the list of circumstances that supported the hypothesis
of a conspiracy. How, then, had the robbery been worked?
Of course the Treasury people, as well as everyone connected
with the Finance Department, to say nothing of
the higher authorities themselves, were in a very perturbed
state of mind, for apart from the largeness of the
sum carried off, the robbery proved that, in spite of the
safeguards employed when money was being conveyed from
one town to another, there was a risk which up to that
time had not been suspected. It was decided at last by
the head officials to offer a reward of ten thousand roubles
for any information that would lead to the capture of the
thieves and the recovery of the stolen money. Danevitch
was opposed to the offering of a reward, and pointed out the
absurdity of it; as he said, even supposing the whole of
the eight men of the escort had been concerned, they were
not likely to betray each other for the sake of ten thousand
roubles, when they had a million to divide amongst themselves.
And if anyone else had come to know who the
thieves were, he would not be blind to the fact that he
could blackmail them to the tune of a much greater sum
than ten thousand roubles to induce him to hold his
tongue. Therefore, as Danevitch anticipated, the reward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
brought forth no informer. In the meantime he had been
working on his own lines, and had satisfied himself the
money had been put into the train all right at Moscow,
and that, unless with the connivance of ever so many
people, the boxes could not have been changed between
the St. Petersburg station and the Treasury Office; consequently,
the business must have been done while the
money was in transit between the two towns. Further than
that, it was as clear as daylight that the robbery had been
prearranged, because the facsimile boxes had been prepared
beforehand; the cord used to bind the false boxes was
Government cord, and the Government seal was so cleverly
imitated that the forgery could only be detected after
close inspection. All this proved unmistakably that there
was a traitor in the camp.</p>

<p>In one of many interviews that Danevitch had with the
Minister of Finance, that gentleman said:</p>

<p>‘Danevitch, you must bring the thief to light. It is
absolutely necessary that an example should be made of
him as a deterrent. Although the loss of the money
would be a serious one, we would rather lose it than let
the thief escape.’</p>

<p>‘I think, sir, that the thief will not escape; and it is
possible, even probable, that the money may be recovered.’</p>

<p>‘Have you any clue?’ asked the Minister quickly.</p>

<p>‘None whatever.’</p>

<p>‘Then, why do you speak so hopefully?’</p>

<p>‘Because it seems to me that sooner or later I am sure
to find a clue, and then—well, then I shall succeed in
bringing the criminal to justice.’</p>

<p>His belief that sooner or later he was sure to find a clue
was quite justified, although he had been doubtful at first.
It was pretty clear now, however, that the thief had an
accomplice, otherwise it would have been impossible for
him to have carried out the robbery. Now, Danevitch
knew too much of human nature to suppose that two or
three men and more than likely a woman, as he shrewdly
suspected, would be able for all time to conceal the fact
that they had suddenly acquired wealth. A something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
would leak out—a something that would betray them to
the keen eyes that were watching for the sign. Danevitch
had learnt the great lesson of patience. He did not aim
at accomplishing the impossible, but he knew where it was
a case of human ingenuity he had the best chance, inasmuch
as he was an expert in the ways of criminals. From
the moment that he had gathered up all the details of the
robbery, he had set a watch upon the movements of every
one of the eight men who had travelled with the treasure
from Moscow to St. Petersburg. The gendarmes belonged
to Moscow, and had returned, but they were watched,
nevertheless; though not a movement of theirs was calculated
to arouse suspicion. The four Government officials
were also watched, but no sign came from them. But of
course they knew they were being watched; they would
have been dolts indeed if they had remained in ignorance
of what everyone else knew; for Government treasure to
the tune of one million roubles could not be abstracted
without causing a sensation and setting the populace on
the tip-toe of expectation and the tenter-hooks of
curiosity. The theory by which Danevitch was guided
was this, that one or more of the eight men who travelled
that night when the money was stolen between Moscow
and St. Petersburg must certainly be in a position to
throw some light on the robbery. On the other hand,
every one of the eight knew for a fact, or by instinct,
that he was suspected of some complicity, consequently he
would take particular care not to do anything calculated
to give emphasis to that suspicion, and justify active legal
measures being taken against him.</p>

<p>Although Danevitch, by reason of the eminence he had
attained in his calling and the originality of mind he had
displayed in dealing with some of the most notorious
crimes of his day, was allowed more latitude than his
confrères, he was nevertheless subordinate at this time to
the chief of the police, and that functionary, having an
eye to a decoration or promotion if the mystery should be
cleared up, strongly advocated the wholesale arrest of the
eight men, and flinging them into a dungeon in the infamous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
fortress of Peter and Paul, or the still more infamous
Schlusselburgh in Lake Ladoga, there to remain
until misery and madness loosened their tongues. Against
this inartistic and brutal measure Danevitch set his face,
and he asked to be allowed to work out the problem in his
own way. The Minister of Finance, and it was said even
the Czar himself, supported Danevitch, so that he was not
hampered with the red-tapeism of the bureau.</p>

<p>A month passed; no arrest had been made, and apparently
not a trace of the criminal discovered. The
Treasury officers were in despair, and the chief of the
police showed a tendency to lower Danevitch from the
high standard of estimation to which he had previously
elevated him. It is true that Danevitch had many big
successes credited to his score, but even a successful man
cannot afford to make a big failure. The chief told him
this, and Danevitch replied quietly:</p>

<p>‘I have not yet made a failure.’</p>

<p>‘But you have not recovered the money; you’ve brought
nobody to book.’</p>

<p>‘No, not yet.’</p>

<p>‘Not yet! Are you still sanguine, then?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly.’</p>

<p>The chief laughed a little bitterly as he replied:</p>

<p>‘Well, perhaps it is good to be sanguine, even in a hopeless
cause. It keeps a man’s spirits up, doesn’t it?’</p>

<p>The chief was comparatively new to his office; that is, he
had only held it two years. He had received very rapid
promotion owing to strong influence at Court, and influence
in Russia often counts a good deal more than merit; indeed,
it does in most countries. It was said that the chief
had certain friends of his own he was anxious to move into
the front rank, hence he was not averse to see Danevitch
go down a bit.</p>

<p>About a week after this conversation between the chief
and Danevitch, an old peasant woman left St. Petersburg
by the Moscow train. She did not book to Moscow, however,
but to a place called Vishni Volotchok, about midway
between the two cities. She was an uncouth, clumsy, burly-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
woman, wearing the big mob frilled cap, the heavy
woollen wrap crossed over the breast, the short homespun
linsey-woolsey gray skirt, coarse gray stockings, and big
shoes of her class. She bore with her a ponderous basket,
containing a stock of slippers, boots, shoes and sabots, and,
being a travelling pedlar, she was furnished with an official
license, a formidable-looking document, stamped and viséd.
In due course she reached her destination. Vishni Volotchok
is a small town of some importance. The station is the
principal refreshment place between St. Petersburg and
Moscow, and a long wait is generally made by the trains
going and coming. The old woman’s license having been
duly examined and viséd, she was allowed to go her ways,
and soon after she proceeded to a fairly large house
situated close to the railway, and facing a road that
crossed the track. It was a detached house, built for the
most part of wood. There were numerous outbuildings—a
large barn, stables, cowsheds, and similar places. It was
the residence of a landed proprietor named Ivan Golovnin.
It was almost dark when the old woman reached the house;
she tried to sell some of her wares to the servants, but was
not successful. Then she pleaded illness, and begged, as
she was a stranger in the town, to be allowed to pass the
night in the barn. With true Russian hospitality, the
servants took her into the great kitchen, and made her up
a bed by the stove. As she had not recovered her health
the next day, she was allowed to remain, and, in fact, finding
herself in comfortable quarters, she stayed for three
days; then she took her departure, before doing so presenting
the three principal servants with a pair of shoes each.
Being market-day, she went into the market, disposed of
the rest of her stock-in-trade, and returned at once to
St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>It chanced that a couple of days after the old woman’s
return to the capital, Danevitch was at the Bureau of
Police, having some business to transact with the chief,
who was excessively busy and excessively bad-tempered.</p>

<p>‘By the way,’ said Danevitch, as he was on the point of
leaving, when he had transacted his affairs, ‘concerning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
robbery of the Treasury notes, I shall <i>succeed</i> in bringing
the criminals to justice.’</p>

<p>The chief glanced at the detective and smiled. It was
not a smile of satisfaction, but of doubt; and yet he knew
that Danevitch had the reputation of never speaking with
anything like certainty unless he felt absolutely sure. But
the chief was somewhat sceptical; it was even possible he
was not altogether free from jealousy, knowing as he did
that Danevitch was looked upon with great favour in high
quarters.</p>

<p>‘There’s a cocksureness in your statement,’ said the
chief brusquely. ‘I suppose you’ve discovered something?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘You must pardon me, but I am not justified in disclosing
even to you at present what I know.’</p>

<p>The chief’s face darkened. He was aware that, though
Danevitch was nominally his subordinate, he had but little
control over him. Nevertheless, it galled him to think
that he, the chief of his department—in Russia it is a very
influential and important position—should not be considered
worthy of the confidence of Danevitch the detective,
high as he was in his calling. He was weak enough to
display his chagrin, and remarked with some warmth:</p>

<p>‘Well, you have your own way of working, of course;
and perhaps you are right, though on the other hand you
may be wrong. But since you do not choose to take me
into your confidence, and as the authorities expect that my
department will unravel the mystery, I must now inform
you that unless you produce evidence within the next
twenty-four hours that you really are on the track of the
criminal or criminals, I shall take the business out of your
hands, and put it into the hands of others.’</p>

<p>Danevitch was not the man to be affected by any such
empty threat as this. Conscious of his own strength, and
firm in the resolve to pursue his own undeviating course, as
he had done for years, uninfluenced by jealousy, criticism,
or the opinions of others, he bowed to the chief and merely
remarked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>‘If in the course of the next twenty-four hours I am in
a position to reveal anything, I will do so. If I am not
you are at liberty to act according to your own views.
Permit me also to remark that, though you are pleased to
doubt my abilities, people in high quarters do not.’</p>

<p>This galled the chief, though he had sufficient tact to
refrain from provoking further argument, which would not
only be profitless, but beget ill-feeling, so he allowed
Danevitch to withdraw.</p>

<p>A fortnight later a wedding was celebrated at the Church
of St. Sophia. It was rather a stylish wedding, and a good
many minor Government officials were present, principally
from the Treasury office. During that intervening fortnight
Danevitch had not given any sign to the chief that
he was making progress; nor had the chief taken any steps
to put his threat into execution. Nevertheless, he had
displayed some impatience, and one day, during an interview
with the Minister of Finance, he said:</p>

<p>‘I am sorry, your Excellency, that we have made no
progress in the Treasury robbery business; but the fact is,
Danevitch’s self-assurance and enthusiasm somewhat misled
him. He speaks confidently where he ought to doubt,
and is hopeful where other men would despair.’</p>

<p>‘Hopefulness is rather a good trait in his character,
isn’t it? You know the old saying, “He who despairs
never succeeds.”’</p>

<p>‘True, your Excellency,’ answered the chief, somewhat
crestfallen. ‘But light-heartedness does not always command
success.’</p>

<p>‘No, perhaps not; but it deserves it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, the fact is this, your Excellency, I am of opinion
myself that more active steps should be taken to bring the
culprits to justice. Now, we have to deal with facts, not
fancies. A very ingenious robbery has been committed,
and the Treasury of the State is a heavy loser. The
thieves must still be in existence, and, being in existence, it
ought not to be beyond the ingenuity of a trained mind
used to working out criminal problems to discover where
they are.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>‘I admit the force of your argument,’ answered the
Minister sedately.</p>

<p>The chief bowed. He was pleased with himself. He
believed he had made an impression.</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ he went on, ‘it is most desirable that the
culprits should be brought to book, and punished in such
an exemplary manner that it would stand out as a warning
for all time, and deter others who might feel tempted to
tamper with the coffers of the State. But desirable as
this is, it is even more desirable that the whole of the
stolen money should be recovered. Your Excellency, however,
will readily see that every day that passes lessens the
chances of that, because the rascals will be revelling in their
ill-gotten gains, and squandering them with the recklessness
peculiar to criminals who enrich themselves dishonestly.’</p>

<p>‘That is not Danevitch’s opinion,’ answered the Minister.</p>

<p>‘Possibly; but presumably he has no warrant for his
opinion. It is a mere expression of opinion, after all—nothing
more.’</p>

<p>‘Let us grant that. Now, what do you suggest?’</p>

<p>What the chief wanted was to have all the credit for
unravelling the mystery. It meant to him promotion, and
strengthening his influence in high quarters. As matters
then stood, there was no confidence between him and
Danevitch, who had so consolidated his position as to be
independent. The chief therefore suggested that Danevitch
should be put upon a case of secondary importance
then occupying the attention of the authorities, and another
man of the chief’s choosing should be selected for Danevitch’s
work. This other man was a creature of the chief,
though he kept that little fact strictly to himself.</p>

<p>The Minister was not deceived by the specious arguments
of his visitor; nor was he so obtuse as to fail to see the
jealousy and ill-will underlying those arguments.</p>

<p>‘Personally, I should object to anyone else taking up
the matter at this stage,’ he said, ‘and as far as my
influence goes I should use it to prevent any change being
made. For myself, I have confidence in Danevitch. He is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
an able man, and until I find that my confidence is misplaced
I shall continue to believe in him.’</p>

<p>The chief was nonplussed, and he felt that it would be
imprudent to pursue the subject any further. He therefore
took his leave. But just as he was in the act of
bowing himself out, the Minister exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘Oh, by the way, on Thursday next there is to be a
marriage in the Church of St. Sophia. A daughter of one
of my subordinates is to wed one Peter Golovnin, the son,
as I understand, of a wealthy landed proprietor. Curiously
enough, I met Danevitch last night by chance, and he
asked me if I was going to the wedding. I told him no,
I had had no invitation; whereupon he expressed surprise
that my subordinate had not paid me the compliment of
inviting me. At the moment there did not seem to me
anything out of the way in the remark, but subsequently,
on pondering over it, I could not help feeling that it was
full of significance. Danevitch had a deep motive in what
he said. Have you any idea what the motive was?’</p>

<p>The chief was not only utterly amazed, but deeply
annoyed. He tried, however, to conceal his annoyance,
though it was very hard to do so. In his own mind he
was perfectly sure that Danevitch had a motive, though
what that motive was he could not possibly guess, and
his annoyance was occasioned by having to confess his
ignorance.</p>

<p>‘And does your Excellency intend to go?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Well, yes, I think I shall. I fancy developments may
take place.’</p>

<p>As the chief went away, he resolved that he, too, would
be present at St. Sophia, for he knew Danevitch too well to
suppose for a moment that his remark to the Minister of
Finance was a meaningless one.</p>

<p>The marriage was rather a grand affair. The bridegroom
was a good-looking young man, about six or seven
and twenty; but he had the appearance of one who had
led a reckless and dissipated life. There were incipient
lines in his face, and a want of brightness about the eyes
that was not good in one so young. The bride was, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
two years younger, with rather pretty features and
an abundance of dark hair. Some affection of the spine,
however, had cruelly distorted her figure, and she was
twisted out of shape. Her name was Olga, and she was
the only sister of Briazga, the Government clerk in the
Finance Department, who was present during the ceremony.
The Minister of Finance was also present, thinking
from Danevitch’s remark that something was to happen.
The wedding went off all right, however, and the whole
party seemed very jolly and happy, until Briazga, suddenly
espying the Minister, went up to him and, looking very
confused and a little excited, said:</p>

<p>‘You do us an honour, sir, by gracing the ceremony
with your delightful presence. I scarcely expected you
would have been here.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose not,’ answered the Minister dryly; ‘but as
you did not honour me with an invitation, nor even condescend
to mention that your sister was to be married, I
thought I would be a witness on my own account.’</p>

<p>Briazga grew more confused, and stammered out a lame
apology, adding:</p>

<p>‘The fact is, sir, I have endeavoured to keep the matter
secret from all except my most intimate friends, for the
simple reason that, as we are comparatively poor people,
we could not afford to have much ceremony, and I felt it
was too humble an affair to ask you to come to it. But
since you have come, may I venture to hope that you will
now do us the supreme honour of joining the luncheon-party
at my house?’</p>

<p>The Minister excused himself on the score of business
engagements; but five minutes later, when Briazga had
left him, and he was going out of the church, Danevitch
came up to him.</p>

<p>‘I saw you talking to Briazga,’ the detective remarked.</p>

<p>‘Did you? Where were you? I didn’t notice you in
the church.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not; but I haven’t been far off. Briazga has
invited you to the luncheon?’</p>

<p>‘How do you know?’ asked the Minister, in surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>‘I guess it.’</p>

<p>‘Then, you must have the power of a seer.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all, your Excellency. Nothing could be simpler.
You being here, your subordinate would have been guilty
of an unpardonable rudeness and affront if he had not
paid you the compliment to invite you. But, of course, it
was a mere formality. He doesn’t wish and does not
intend you to go if he can prevent it.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose not; nor do I wish to go.’</p>

<p>‘But I should like you to go,’ answered Danevitch.
‘Indeed, I consider it of some importance that you should
go. A little drama may be enacted in which you can play
a part.’</p>

<p>The Minister looked hard at Danevitch, as if trying to
read his thoughts, and asked pointedly:</p>

<p>‘Do you suspect Briazga of having stolen the Treasury
notes?’</p>

<p>‘Will you pardon me for simply saying at this moment
that it would be imprudent for me to answer your
question?’</p>

<p>‘Will you be there?’</p>

<p>‘Again I must respectfully decline to answer the
question.’</p>

<p>‘But you have an object in wishing me to be present.’</p>

<p>‘Undoubtedly.’</p>

<p>‘Then I will go.’</p>

<p>Whereupon the Minister hastily pencilled a note on a
slip of paper torn from his note-book, and sent it by one
of the church attendants to Briazga. In the note he simply
said he had changed his mind, and would do himself the
pleasure of being present at the wedding-feast, as he found
he had a couple of spare hours on his hands. Danevitch
moved off, and had not got far away, when he was accosted
by the chief of the police, who remarked sarcastically:</p>

<p>‘I understood there were to be some developments at
this wedding.’</p>

<p>‘From whom did you understand that?’ asked Danevitch,
without any attempt to conceal the annoyance he
felt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>‘It is not necessary to mention names. I heard that
you were to be here, and the Minister of Finance was to
be here. The information was significant, so I came too.
You suspect somebody amongst this marriage-party?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Who is it?’</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, I decline to state at the present moment.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because I have no proof.’</p>

<p>‘You are seeking a proof, then?’</p>

<p>‘I am.’</p>

<p>‘Do you expect to find it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Where and when?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot say. It’s problematical. A few hours will
decide. As soon as I am sure of my ground I will report
to you.’</p>

<p>The chief recognised the uselessness of further questioning,
and left, while Danevitch withdrew into the background
as the wedding-party left the church and drove to
Briazga’s house. He lived in what was known as the
English quarter, near the English quay. There were no
English living there then. Bad times and oppressive
restrictions had ruined most of them, and they had gone
away. The house inhabited by Briazga had been formerly
occupied by an English merchant; it had many conveniences
and improvements not usually found in the average
Russian house. Here the Government clerk had lived
very comfortably with his father, mother, and sister Olga.
The father and mother were well advanced in years. They
had a small income of their own to live upon.</p>

<p>Soon after the wedding-party had arrived at the house, an
old woman, a professional fortune-teller, presented herself
and begged to be admitted. There was nothing unusual
in this. Vagrants of both sexes make a good living in
Russia by attending wedding-parties and forecasting the
future of the bride and bridegroom. As the Russians are
a superstitious people, they encourage these fortune-tellers,
who are feasted, and generally add to the entertainment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
by story and jest. Having been treated well in the
servants’ quarter, the woman was introduced to the company.
The bridegroom, who was hilarious and full of
vodka and wine, immediately presented himself to have
his fortune told; but when the woman had looked at his
hand and peered into his eyes, while the company waited
in breathless expectancy, she said:</p>

<p>‘I cannot tell you your fortune.’</p>

<p>At this there was considerable laughing and jeering,
and on all sides arose the question, ‘Why, why?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, ladies and gentlemen,’ exclaimed the seer, ‘pray
don’t laugh. I can read all your fortunes—better, perhaps,
than you would like me to do.’</p>

<p>‘Then, why don’t you begin with the bridegroom?’ was
asked by several. ‘He is anxious to know what is before
him.’</p>

<p>‘Good; it shall be told,’ answered the woman sharply.
‘Give me a pack of cards.’</p>

<p>The pack of cards was brought. She spread the cards on
the table in several rows. Next she shifted them about,
and placed them in squares and circles, and all the time
the company gathered round and waited in eager expectancy
for what was coming. Presently the woman
jumbled the cards up together, then repacked them and
told the bridegroom to cut them four times, and the bride
three. That done, the fortune-teller seemed absorbed in
some abstruse calculation as she slowly sorted the cards out
in four rows.</p>

<p>‘You are a precious long time,’ exclaimed the bridegroom
irritably. ‘It strikes me you are a humbug.’</p>

<p>‘Patience, patience,’ murmured the woman. ‘There is
something wrong about the cards. They won’t come right.’</p>

<p>‘Because you don’t understand them,’ suggested somebody.</p>

<p>‘Possibly; but patience, patience; I shall understand
them directly. Ah! I see something now. It’s strange,
very strange!’</p>

<p>The curiosity and interest of the company were fully
aroused by the mysterious manner of the old woman, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
seemed deeply absorbed in what she was doing; but
Briazga was annoyed, and he called out:</p>

<p>‘Ladies and gentlemen, let us stop this nonsense. The
woman is an impostor, and is only wasting our time, which
can be more joyfully and pleasurably employed. It is an
auspicious occasion, this, and we don’t want it marred by
any unpleasant incident. Let us banish the woman to the
kitchen.’</p>

<p>At these words the old fortune-teller drew herself up
with a certain dignity, and remarked:</p>

<p>‘It is customary for my people to be kindly and hospitably
entertained at these festive gatherings; and I
myself have the reputation of being a most successful
fortune-teller; it is not my fault now that the cards will
not come right. But I read certain things about the
bridegroom which I am sure he would like to know. Say,
shall I proceed?’</p>

<p>The bridegroom himself answered.</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ he exclaimed, and there was a curious look
on his wine-flushed face. ‘I want to know my future; let
the woman go on.’</p>

<p>Briazga appeared to be very greatly irritated, but as
there arose a murmured assent from the assembly he
yielded to the evident desire of his guests, who now
crowded round the table and urged the fortune-teller to
rearrange the cards. This she did, and having laid them
out again in five rows, she uttered an ejaculatory ‘Ah!’
and after a pause added:</p>

<p>‘It is better; but still there is a block somewhere. Can
you, sir’—this to the bridegroom—‘place on the table five
thousand rouble notes? That will perhaps break the
spell.’</p>

<p>It was a common thing for these fortune-tellers to
request that small sums of money might be produced;
but five thousand roubles was a large sum, and there was
a general murmur of surprise, while Briazga appeared to
be particularly uneasy and troubled. He was trying to
push his way through the crowd to get at his brother-in-law,
for there was such a hubbub and din of voices that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
he could not make himself heard; but before he succeeded
in accomplishing his purpose, Peter Golovnin, with a
boastful air and a drunken leer on his red face, pulled
from his pocket a leather wallet, which, on opening, was
found to be stuffed full of notes. With an unsteady hand
he proceeded to count out five notes of the value of one
thousand roubles each. Having done so, he laid the notes
upon the table, and once more there was breathless silence
as the company craned their necks in their eagerness to see
what the old woman would now do. The bridegroom himself
seemed the least concerned of anyone, and, with a
coarse, drunken laugh, remarked:</p>

<p>‘I suppose the old fool thought I did not possess so
much money. It shows what an impostor she is, otherwise
she would have been able to tell you exactly how much I
have in my wallet. However, let her go on, and if she
fails this time I will kick her out.’</p>

<p>The fortune-teller seemed in no ways affected by the
threat, but busied herself in rearranging the cards. She
spread out the five bank-notes. On each of four she
placed a knave from the pack, and on the fifth she put a
queen. Suspicious eyes watched her every movement, as
more than one person present was of opinion that she
wanted to purloin the money by some hanky-panky
business.</p>

<p>‘There is a lot of knavery here,’ she remarked thoughtfully.
‘The queen, as you will see, is the victim of knaves,
and I am afraid will come to grief.’</p>

<p>‘Who does the queen represent?’ asked someone.</p>

<p>‘The bride,’ answered the fortune-teller.</p>

<p>At this there was a strong murmur of disapproval, and
the bridegroom, with an angry cry, put out his hand to
sweep up the notes, but the woman, quicker than he,
gathered them in a heap, and said sternly:</p>

<p>‘Do not touch them for a moment, or you will break
the spell.’ Then suddenly she snatched them up, and
exclaimed: ‘These notes are forged ones. That accounts
for my difficulty.’</p>

<p>This was the signal for a general uproar, and the company,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
believing that the woman wished to steal the money,
seized her, and she would have been roughly handled had she
not shaken herself free, and energetically forced her way to
the Minister of Finance, who was present, and, thrusting
the notes into his hand, said:</p>

<p>‘Sir, I know you; you are the Minister of Finance.
Look at those notes. They are forged! I give them into
your keeping. No man has a right to have false notes in
his possession. You, sir, as an officer of the State, have it
in your power to demand an explanation. Ask the bridegroom,
your Excellency, why he carries forged notes in his
purse.’</p>

<p>The Minister took the notes, though he seemed distressed
and puzzled.</p>

<p>‘The wretched hag lies!’ thundered the bridegroom.
‘The notes are perfectly good. My brother-in-law, if he
respects me and the good name of his family, and loves his
sister, my wife, will order his servants to whip this lying
fortune-teller, who has broken up our party and destroyed
our pleasure.’</p>

<p>There was a disposition on the part of some of those
present to act on the suggestion made, and subject the old
woman to rough treatment; but the Minister, holding up
his hand in a deprecatory manner, said:</p>

<p>‘Ladies and gentlemen, control yourselves, please. Keep
quiet. The woman is quite right. These notes are not
genuine ones. But no doubt Mr. Golovnin can offer some
explanation as to how they came into his possession.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ cried Golovnin excitedly. ‘They were given to
me by my father, and I cannot believe they are false. If
they are, then he himself has been cheated, and it will
break his heart.’</p>

<p>‘That the notes are not genuine, there can be no possible
doubt,’ said the Minister gravely; ‘and that you or your
father should be in possession of forged notes representing
so large a sum is extraordinary.’</p>

<p>‘I pray you return them to me,’ wailed the bridegroom,
looking very sorrowful and sad, while his trembling bride
stood beside him the picture of puzzled distress. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
seemed scarcely able to realize the situation, and her
tearful eyes wandered from her husband to her brother,
and from him to the Minister of Finance, as if in dumb
entreaty to clear the mystery up, and not mar the pleasure
of her wedding-day. But the Minister, although not there
in any judicial position, clearly recognised that, as a
servant of the State, he had a duty to perform, and,
despite the painfulness of the situation in which he thus
found himself, he felt forced to that duty.</p>

<p>‘I cannot return the notes,’ he said gravely, ‘and I must
ask you to let me examine the other notes in your wallet.’</p>

<p>At this request, Golovnin pulled out his pocket-book
without the slightest hesitation, and, producing a packet
of notes, handed them—with the air of a man conscious of
his own rectitude—to the Minister, who, having subjected
them to a close scrutiny, pronounced them to be forgeries
also.</p>

<p>The company were startled by this into a united cry of
astonishment and alarm, while the unhappy bride, with a
low moan, fell to the floor in a swoon.</p>

<p>‘Surely, sir, there is some mistake,’ suggested Briazga,
pallid and pale as a corpse.</p>

<p>‘Of course it’s a mistake,’ shouted the bridegroom;
‘his Excellency is wrong—entirely wrong. It is impossible
the notes can be forged. I am sure they are genuine.’</p>

<p>‘Briazga,’ said the Minister sternly, ‘you have been
handling notes long enough in the Treasury to be able to
tell a genuine one from a false one. Look at these, and
give me your honest opinion.’</p>

<p>The Minister placed the notes on the table. Briazga
took them up with a trembling hand one by one, and
examined them, holding them to the light, and subjecting
them to other tests, while the amazed guests held their
breath in anxious suspense, as they waited for his verdict.
Slowly and deliberately, notwithstanding that he was
suffering from intense nervous emotion, Briazga went
through the notes one by one, while his superior watched
him intently and curiously. At last, when he had finished
his task, he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>‘Sir, I am forced to confess that every note there is
nothing more than a clever imitation. But my brother-in-law
must surely be the dupe of a knavish trick. The
matter is capable of explanation.’</p>

<p>‘It must certainly be investigated,’ answered the Minister.
‘It is far too serious to be lightly passed over. I shall have
to carry the notes away, and consult with the authorities
as to the steps to be taken.’</p>

<p>‘Stay,’ exclaimed the bridegroom, with a pitiful wail of
despair; ‘this may mean for me utter and irretrievable
ruin. Remember, sir, it is my wedding-day, and my ruin
involves also the ruin, and perhaps the death, of my wife,
who has been my wife not yet a day; to say nothing of
the ruin, dishonour, disgrace of those near and dear to me.
Let me beseech of you, therefore, to delay taking any
action until I myself have made inquiries. I am convinced—absolutely
convinced—there is some hideous mistake
somewhere. I am the victim of a cowardly trick. I will
swear on oath that when I left home the notes I put into
my pocket were good ones. Is it not possible that the
hag of a fortune-teller has brought this about by her
devilish art?’</p>

<p>At this everybody looked to see where the ‘hag’ was,
but she had made herself invisible. In the hubbub and
confusion consequent on the discovery that the notes were
forged, she had managed to slip away unperceived, and had
left the house.</p>

<p>‘I regret very much indeed,’ answered the Minister,
‘that such an unhappy affair as this should have occurred
on your wedding-day; but it is far too grave a circumstance
for me to adopt the course you suggest. In fact, I
should not be justified in doing so. I repeat, I have a duty
to perform, and I must do it, however unpleasant the consequences
may be. Of course, as you say, the matter is
capable of explanation, and any explanation you may offer
will receive due attention; but a very serious official inquiry
will have to be made, and the origin of these notes must
be traced.’</p>

<p>With a dignified bow to the dumfounded company, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Minister passed out of the room and left the house, carrying
the notes with him. On reaching his official residence,
he found a letter waiting for him. It was from Danevitch,
and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>‘<span class="smcap">Your Excellency</span>,</p>

<p>‘I am suddenly called away from St. Petersburg,
but shall be back in three days’ time. I am happy to say
I can restore the whole of the stolen notes to the Treasury.
I hope your Excellency enjoyed yourself at the house of
Briazga on the occasion of the wedding-feast.’</p>
</div>

<p>The Minister was a little mystified by this letter; and
though he knew that Danevitch was not the man to make
a rash statement, he sent for the chief of the police and
questioned him. But that worthy had to confess that he
himself was no less mystified. He said some harsh things
about Danevitch, and even went so far as to express some
doubt whether Danevitch was capable of fulfilling his
undertaking to restore the whole of the stolen money.</p>

<p>‘I’ve faith in Danevitch,’ said the Minister. ‘What he
says he means; and though he puzzles me very much, I
feel certain that all will come right in the end.’</p>

<p>The chief had no answer to this, so he simply bowed
and took his leave.</p>

<p>True to his promise, Danevitch returned to St. Petersburg
in three days’ time, and, to the amazement of the
officials and all concerned, he duly delivered to the
Treasury the whole of the missing million roubles, and
was enabled to lay such information before the authorities
that Briazga and Ivan and Peter Golovnin were immediately
arrested.</p>

<p>Ivan Golovnin lived at Vishni Volotchok, where he owned
some property. He was an old man, and had been married
twice. By his first wife he had had a large family, and
they were nearly all scattered. By his second wife he had
one son, Peter. This young fellow had been a managing
clerk in a fur store in St. Petersburg, and had known
Briazga’s family some years. Olga Briazga had fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
desperately in love with him, but her deformity prevented
him reciprocating her passion. Between Olga and her
brother an extraordinary affection existed—an affection
unusual even between brother and sister. He idolized her;
and when he saw she was breaking her heart about Peter,
and that her life was in danger, he told Peter he would
enrich him if he would marry her. From this a conspiracy
was hatched, in which Briazga, Peter and Peter’s father
joined interests. The old man was induced to enter into
it for his son’s sake. It was prearranged that when
Briazga was next engaged in the duty of conveying
treasure from Moscow to St. Petersburg, an attempt
should be made to purloin some of it; but from the first he
gave his co-conspirators distinctly to understand that, while
he would do all he possibly could to assist them, he would
not keep a single rouble himself. The opportunity came
at last with the removal of treasure from Moscow. Briazga
knew a week beforehand that he would be employed upon
the duty, and he also knew what money would be removed.
Everything, therefore, seemed to favour him, and he lost
no time in communicating the intelligence to the Golovnins.
Peter at once set to work to prepare two facsimile boxes,
and to fill them with paper, the whole being the exact
weight of the Government boxes when filled with a million’s
worth of rouble notes. The Government cord and the
forged seal were supplied by Briazga. The train conveying
the treasure stopped for a long time at Vishni Volotchok,
that being a buffet station where passengers usually dined
or supped. The night of the robbery happened to be very
dark and very hot. On arriving at Vishni Volotchok, the
treasure escort went four at a time to the buffet to eat and
drink. Briazga was included in the first four. When they
had finished they relieved the other four; but the night
being sultry, Briazga’s party sauntered about the platform
smoking, the door of the treasure waggon being locked.
On the plea of getting some tobacco, Briazga returned to
the waggon; he was not absent more than ten minutes—indeed,
not so long; but during the time he was enabled
to open the off-side door with a secret key, and to hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
out the two boxes to Peter, who was lying in wait with the
dummies. Thus was the robbery cleverly committed, as
proved by the evidence twisted and wormed out of the
culprits themselves by the inquisitorial nature of the
Russian law.</p>

<p>The sequel of the remarkable story has yet to be told.
When Danevitch took the matter up, he came to the conclusion
after a time that the robbery had taken place at Vishni
Volotchok. There were numerous and obvious reasons for
that conclusion. It was no less obvious that one or more
of the eight persons composing the escort must have had
some hand in the robbery. He soon determined in his own
mind that the gendarmes were guiltless. This reduced the
suspects to the four Government officials. Now, assuming
that the deduction was a correct one, it was no less clear
that there must have been a confederate at Vishni Volotchok;
so Danevitch set to work to find out which of the officials
had any connection with that place, and he soon ascertained
that the Briazgas and the Golovnins were acquainted.
That stage of the inquiry reached, he began to feel that he
would ultimately succeed in unravelling the mystery. The
means that he employed to track down his quarry Danevitch
was careful never to make public, for very obvious
reasons, but he had a habit of setting them forth fully
in his diary, and from that source I am able to give them
here.</p>

<p>It was known almost throughout Russia that this remarkable
man had a protean-like faculty for changing his
appearance. He could so alter his voice and features that,
in combination with change of dress, he could defy detection
even by those who were well acquainted with him.
His most favourite disguise was that of an old woman,
whom he could imitate to the life. In the character of a
female, therefore, he penetrated into the Golovnins’ home.
He found, by close watching, that Peter made frequent
journeys backwards and forwards between the house and a
small plantation of firs, about a quarter of a mile away.
As there was no apparent reason why the young man
should go to the plantation so often, Danevitch was induced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
to search it, with the result that he found the two
stolen boxes artfully concealed in an old quarry, which was
almost entirely hidden by creepers and brambles. The
boxes had been opened, but the contents were intact.
This find was a great triumph for Danevitch, but his work
was far from complete. It was necessary that he should
spread a net that would capture all the culprits, and he
carried this out with singular ingenuity. That one or
both of the Golovnins had had a hand in the robbery was
pretty evident, but others must also have been concerned,
and they might escape if caution was not observed. When
he ascertained that Peter Golovnin and Olga Briazga were
on the eve of marriage, the plot seemed to make itself
clear to him, and when he gained entrance to the marriage-feast
in the rôle of fortune-teller, his triumph was complete.
In the boxes hidden in the wood at Vishni
Volotchok he had placed a large number of cleverly imitated
notes, taking the genuine ones away. The imitations had
been lying at one of the police bureaus for a very long
time. They had been seized on the premises of a notorious
note-forger. Danevitch was sure that Peter Golovnin, the
bridegroom, would liberally supply himself with money
from the boxes for his marriage, and if the forged notes
were found in his possession, the evidence would be overwhelming.</p>

<p>It remains to say that the guilt was brought home to all
concerned. They were condemned to death, as they had
committed a crime against the State, but the sentence was
commuted to banishment for life to Siberia. Poor Olga
Briazga, whose love for Peter Golovnin had been the cause
of the crime, accompanied her unhappy husband to
Northern Siberia, where he was doomed to pass the first
ten years of his sentence.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">A MODERN BORGIA.</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> his long and remarkable career, Danevitch was
called upon to solve problems of a very varied nature, and,
while his efforts were not always crowned with success—and
he never hesitates in his journals to confess his failures—the
percentage of his triumphs was very large. Necessarily,
of course, his work lay amongst the by-ways and
alleys of life, so to speak; for so long as there are crimes
and criminals—and that will be as long as the world lasts—men
must be found who will endeavour to lessen the one
and bring the other to book. In his own particular way,
Danevitch was a genius; and it almost seemed sometimes
as if Nature had endowed him with an eighth sense, for he
saw and grasped points which no one else could see.
Although a born detective, there are many other callings
in which he might have risen to eminence, notably that of
the stage. He was a perfect actor, and his powers of
mimicry and of changing his expression and personal
appearance were little short of marvellous. He could with
ease assume the rôle of an ambassador or a peasant market
woman, and he possessed to a remarkable degree the faculty
of patience, which is indispensable to anyone who wishes to
distinguish himself in the detective’s art. Moreover, he
was well educated, and a fluent linguist, and these accomplishments
helped him immensely. In referring to the
case which I am now about to relate, he himself speaks of
it as ‘a remarkable and complicated one,’ which all but
baffled him; and he cites it as an example of the depths of
depravity to which human nature is capable of descending.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>It appeared that one summer night Colonel Ignatof,
who was in command of an infantry regiment of the line,
temporarily stationed in Moscow, returned to his barracks
after being out all the evening, and, complaining of being
very ill, ordered that the regimental doctor should be
immediately sent for. From the time that the order was
given to the arrival of the doctor in the commanding
officer’s room not more than ten minutes elapsed. But
during that short space the Colonel had vomited violently,
and the doctor found him lying on the bed, cold, pallid,
and collapsed. The soldier-servant who was with him
said that his master had suffered awfully, and had described
his feelings as if a fire was raging in his inside. The
doctor administered remedies, which so far had a good
effect that the patient rallied, and on being asked if he
could account for his sudden illness—he had always been
an exceedingly robust and healthy man—he faintly murmured
that he believed it was attributable to some iced
fish soup (a favourite Russian dish), of which he had
partaken freely. He thought it probable that the fish
from which the soup had been concocted were not quite
fresh. It seemed a natural supposition, for the intense
heat of the short Russian summer makes it very difficult to
keep meat and fish fresh for many hours.</p>

<p>He was next asked where he had partaken of the soup,
but before he could give an answer he was again seized
with violent retching. When the spasm had passed, he
collapsed once more, and all the remedies that were tried
failed to restore him. He continued, however, to breathe
for two hours, and then died. As the symptoms from
which the unfortunate man had suffered were identical
with those set up by irritant poison, an order was received
that a post-mortem examination was to be made. In due
course this order was carried out, and resulted in the discovery
that death was due to an irritant poison that had
set up violent inflammation of the stomach. This seemed
to be quite consistent with the unfortunate man’s own
theory that his illness was due to unwholesome soup.</p>

<p>The fish soup is a very common dish in Russia. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
made from various kinds of fish boiled to a pulp. It
is then highly seasoned, thickened with rich, luscious cream;
a quantity of olive-oil is next added, and the mess is iced
until it is nearly frozen. It is a singularly seductive dish,
but only those who have strong stomachs can stand it. As
it is only partaken of in the summer, great care has to be
exercised that the fish is quite fresh. Any carelessness in
this respect is apt to produce serious illness. The peasantry,
who cannot afford cream, and enrich the soup with large
quantities of inferior oil, often suffer severely, and not
infrequently die, after a hearty meal of this national soup,
for as often as not the fish used is stale, and, as most
people know, decaying fish is a virulent poison.</p>

<p>It was a knowledge of these facts which no doubt led
the medical men to jump to the conclusion that the
Colonel’s death was entirely due to the soup, a conclusion
that seemed quite justified by what the dying man himself
had said. Some attempt was made to discover where he
had dined, but as this was not successful, the doctors
certified that the deceased had died from internal inflammation
after partaking of soup which was probably
not fresh. Here the matter ended. The dead man was
buried with military pomp and ceremony, and many
eulogies were uttered over his grave. It was known
amongst his intimate friends that he was a married man,
but owing to ‘incompatibility’ he and his wife had long
lived apart. All his effects he left by will to a nephew
named Peter Baranoff, who was a Captain in an artillery
regiment, which was also stationed in Moscow.</p>

<p>It was generally supposed that Colonel Ignatof was well
off, if not wealthy, but it became known after his death
that he died worth very little. This gave rise to much
gossip, and it was more than hinted that he had squandered
his means and substance on a certain lady to whom
he had been greatly attached. However, these little
incidents were not so rare as to cause any great surprise,
and the Colonel and his affairs were soon forgotten, and
the world went on as usual. Colonel Ignatof had been in
his grave about twelve months, when Moscow was furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
with another sensation. Although he had died poor,
relatively, his nephew had got something like three
thousand pounds, besides a fair amount of jewellery, some
plate, books, and other odds and ends. The young fellow
had never been very steady, and after his uncle’s death
launched out into excesses which brought him under the
notice of his superiors; and he was warned that he would
have to regulate his conduct a little better or he might be
called upon to resign his commission, as his name was
mixed up with a good many scandals, and there had been
much talk about certain gambling debts he had incurred
and was unable to meet. However, an unexpected and
effective stop was put to his ‘goings on,’ and set everybody
talking again.</p>

<p>Late one night a man was picked up near one of the
gates of the Kremlin wall in a state of unconsciousness,
and was conveyed by a police patrol to the nearest station-house,
as the natural inference was that he was intoxicated.
He was speedily identified as Captain Peter Baranoff, from
cards and letters found in his pockets. Within half an
hour of his admission his symptoms had become so serious
as to cause alarm, and it was deemed advisable to communicate
with the military authorities. No time was lost
in doing this, but before any instructions could be received
Baranoff collapsed, and within an hour of his admission he
was dead, in spite of all the efforts made to restore him to
consciousness and prolong his life.</p>

<p>The case, as may be supposed, surrounded with mystery
as it was, caused an immense sensation. The deceased
man’s social position, his connection with the army, and
the financial difficulties in which it was thought he was
involved, removed the matter out of the sphere of an
ordinary affair, and it was the ‘talk of the town.’ As no
reason could be assigned for his premature decease, an
autopsy was made, and it was then found that, as in his
uncle’s case, there was violent inflammation of the coats of
the stomach and the intestinal track. In the stomach
itself were the remains of some half-digested morsels of
fish; and it was also made evident that a little while before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
his death the deceased had partaken freely of vodka. This
led to the supposition—which was probably correct—that
intoxication was accountable for the unconscious condition
in which he was found; but intoxication would not account
for his death. He was a young fellow of splendid physique,
and none of the organs were diseased. His death, therefore,
was not due to any natural cause; and after some
discussion amongst the medical men, it was decided to
certify that he had died from eating impure food, which,
by its poisonous action, had set up inflammation, which had
been much aggravated by the vodka. Of course, there was
a good deal of curiosity to know where he had spent the
evening, and how it was he should have been wandering
alone outside of the Kremlin until he fell unconscious.
The inference was that he had been revelling with friends
at one or other of the numerous haunts which abound in
Moscow, and which often lure young men to their destruction.
Some attempt was made to trace his movements on
the evening of his death; but all the attempt resulted in
was that it was proved he left his quarters between six and
seven. He was in private clothes, and he incidentally
mentioned to a friend that he was going to the opera,
and afterwards intended to sup with a lady acquaintance.
He did go to the opera, but left early—that is, before
ten o’clock. From that time until he was picked up
unconscious later there was a blank that could not be
filled in.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, at this time there was no suspicion of
foul play. That he should die in a similar manner to his
uncle was considered rather remarkable, but there the
surprise ended. But within a week of the burial a sharp-eyed
and thoughtful medical student, who was pursuing
his studies in the great college at Moscow, addressed a few
lines to the <i>Moscow Gazette</i>, in which he ventured to
suggest that the doctors who examined Baranoff’s body
had failed in their duty in not causing a chemical analysis
to be made of the contents of the deceased man’s stomach;
and he advanced the opinion that both Baranoff and his
uncle had been wilfully done to death.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>At first this idea was laughed at. It was spoken of as
being ‘ridiculous,’ and the suspicion of foul play utterly
unjustified. In a few hours, however, public opinion
changed. It would be difficult to tell why, unless on the
hypothesis that a new sensation was wanted. A clamour
arose, and grave doubts were thrown upon the doctors’
judgment. Now, in Russia public opinion has not the
weight that it has in England, and the popular voice is
often stifled whenever it begins to grow a little too loud.
But in this case there were certain details which lent a
good deal of weight to the suspicion of foul play; and in
official quarters, after much discussion, it was considered
advisable that some notice should be taken of it. Probably
it would have been otherwise but for the seeming fact that
the medical men had done their duty in a very perfunctory
way, and had not been at sufficient pains to establish the
accuracy of the conclusion they came to from what they
saw during their scientific investigations. It was pointed
out that all the symptoms exhibited by the two men were
quite compatible with the suggestions of drug-poisoning;
that the theory that both met their end through inadvertently
partaking of stale fish was so remarkable
a coincidence that it could not be regarded as a commonplace
matter; and that in the interest of justice, no less
than of science, some further investigation should be permitted.</p>

<p>In the end an official order was issued that Baranoff’s
body should be exhumed, and the usual means taken to
test, by the aid of chemical knowledge, whether or not the
deceased man came by death through an accident, through
natural causes, or as the victim of foul play. In order
to leave nothing to be desired in the way of research, a
Professor of Chemistry, who stood at the very top of the
profession, was instructed to make the analysis. This he
did, with the result that he came to the conclusion that the
deceased had met his death from a strong dose of black
hellebore. As soon as the authorities were informed of
the result of the analysis, they had Colonel Ignatof’s body
taken up and subjected to chemical examination. And in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
this instance also the Professor declared that death had
been brought about by black hellebore.</p>

<p>At this period black hellebore was by no means a well-known
poison outside the medical profession, and the
average doctor was perhaps quite ignorant of the morbid
symptoms it set up in the human subject when a fatal dose
was administered. It is classed amongst what is known as
the true narcotico-acrids, and bears the botanical name of
<i>Helleborus niger</i>, and is familiar to the general public as
the Christmas rose. Few people, however, who admire the
beautiful rose-tinted flowers of the Christmas rose, which
serve to enliven the house in the gloomy winter months,
have any idea how deadly a poison can be extracted from
its roots and leaves. Its active principle, according to
chemists, is an oily matter containing an acid. Its effects
on the human being are violent retching and vomiting,
delirium, convulsions, and intense internal pains. These
symptoms generally appear in from an hour to two hours
after the fatal dose is swallowed, and death usually results
in about six hours. If administered in alcohol or food of
any kind, no suspicion is aroused on the part of the person
who takes it, as the taste is quite disguised. The morbid
appearances produced in the human body are inflammation
of the stomach, the digestive canal, and particularly the
great intestines. Poisonous fish or food of any kind
almost will produce these symptoms. Therefore the medical
men who certified that Colonel Ignatof and his nephew,
Captain Baranoff, both died from the effects of impure fish
used for soup were misled, and jumped to too hasty a conclusion.
Some excuse would be found for them, however,
in the fact that the effects of hellebore were not as well
known then as now; at any rate, not in Russia. And as
the Colonel’s own dying opinion was that his illness was
due to the iced fish soup he had partaken of, it was perhaps
pardonable, all the other circumstances considered,
that the doctors should have been put upon a false scent,
and it is pretty certain that but for the medical student’s
letter to the <i>Moscow Gazette</i>, which sounded the alarm, no
suspicion of foul play would have been aroused.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Like most vegetable poisons, hellebore is difficult to
detect, and it can only be discovered in the dead body by
means of the most delicate tests. The chemical Professor
who was charged with the important duty of examining
the remains of Ignatof and Baranoff had made toxicology
an especial study, and he had given particular attention to
the very large class of vegetable poisons, having travelled
for this purpose in various countries. He stood at the
head of his profession in Russia, and it was owing to his
skill and care, and the technical knowledge he brought to
bear, that he was enabled, beyond all doubt, to establish
the fact that the two subjects he was charged to examine
were the victims of poison.</p>

<p>So much having been determined, the question was
mooted whether or not the poison had been administered
wilfully or accidentally. The theory of accident was at
once negatived. It was like an outrage on common-sense
to ask anyone to believe that two men, related to each
other, should each die within a year from precisely the
same cause. The coincidence was too remarkable to be
admitted as probable; therefore the matter resolved itself
into murder—it was an ugly word, and all the incidents
suggested a tragedy of no ordinary kind. The case was
placed in the hands of the chief of police, who was
instructed to use every means possible to unravel the
mystery. An attempt was at once made to trace the
movements of the two men for some hours before their
death. In the Colonel’s case this was not an easy matter,
as he had been dead for a year; but it was discovered that
Captain Baranoff called on a friend of his—a civilian
named Alexander Vlassovsky, who lived in a villa just on
the fringe of the town—and they went together to a café-restaurant,
where they dined. After dinner they played
billiards for a short time, when they separated, as Vlassovsky
had an assignation with a lady. He did not know
where Baranoff was going to. He did not ask him, and
the Captain volunteered no information. It was proved,
however, that he went to the opera, and left about ten.
It was stated most positively that when Baranoff quitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the café he was in the pink of health, and in most excellent
spirits. Some hours later he was found in a state of unconsciousness
outside of the Kremlin walls. It followed,
therefore, if the story about the café was correct—and
there was no reason to doubt it—that Baranoff must have
partaken of the fatal dose a short time before he was
discovered, for the action of the poison is very rapid.
From the time, however, of his leaving to the time he was
discovered unconscious all remained a blank. Nothing
could be ascertained of his movements. It was obvious
that wherever he had been to, or whoever were the people
he had been with, somebody had an interest in keeping his
movements dark, as the efforts of the police quite failed to
elicit any information. It was the same in the Colonel’s
case, and no one could discover where he had been to on
the fatal night. Moscow is a large city, honeycombed
with evil haunts; crime flourishes there to a greater extent
than in any other town or city in the whole of Russia. It
has been the scene of very many deeds of violence, for
blackguardism is rampant, and numerous are the traps for
the unwary. Its population is perhaps more varied than
that of any other city of the world. Here may be seen
cut-throats from the Levant; fishermen and sailors from
the Baltic; Circassians, Cossacks, Tartars, Persians, Bokharians,
Georgians, Greeks, and Jews of almost every
nationality. It may be imagined that in such a place,
and amongst such a heterogeneous collection of humanity,
wickedness of every description finds a congenial soil.
Notwithstanding that, Moscow is known to all Russians
as ‘The Holy City,’ and a devout Russian, who pins his
faith to the Russo-Greek Church, regards Moscow with the
same veneration that a Mohammedan looks upon Mecca.</p>

<p>After several weeks of fruitless effort to solve the
mystery in which the deaths of Colonel Ignatof and his
nephew was involved, the police had to confess themselves
baffled. It seemed pretty evident that both men had been
cruelly done to death by the hand of an assassin. But
whose was the hand that committed the deed, and the
motive for it, could not be ascertained.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>It was at this stage of the proceedings that a request
was made to Michael Danevitch—who was then in St.
Petersburg—to come through to Moscow, and endeavour
to solve the mystery. He complied with the request, and
at once waited upon General Govemykin, the military
governor of the city, by the General’s special desire.</p>

<p>‘I want you,’ said the General, ‘to use every means
that your skill can suggest to clear up the mystery surrounding
the deaths of Colonel Ignatof and Captain
Baranoff. Both these gentlemen were murdered; of that
there seems to be no doubt; and the murderers must be
brought to book. During the last few years a good many
soldiers have lost their lives in this city by foul play, and
in several instances justice has gone unsatisfied. Now two
officers, men of unblemished reputation and good social
position, are killed by the same means, and yet the police
are unable to bring the crime home to anyone. It seems
to me that it is little short of disgraceful that the police
supervision of a city like this is so deficient.’</p>

<p>‘Is it deficient?’ asked Danevitch.</p>

<p>‘Yes; otherwise, how is it officers and gentlemen can be
brutally done to death and the murderers escape?’</p>

<p>‘As far as I gather, this is no ordinary crime,’ remarked
Danevitch.</p>

<p>‘Well, perhaps not; but it shows a weakness in the
organization when our police fail to get the slightest clue
to the perpetrator of the crime. Now, what are you
going to do?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ Danevitch answered, as brusquely as the
General asked the question.</p>

<p>‘If you don’t know, what is the use of your taking the
matter in hand?’</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, General, but I am not a prophet, therefore
I cannot foretell what I am going to do.’</p>

<p>‘Well, no, perhaps not; but you must have some idea
of the lines you intend to proceed upon.’</p>

<p>‘I shall simply try to succeed where the police have failed.’</p>

<p>‘And you may fail, too,’ exclaimed the General, who
was a little piqued by Danevitch’s brusqueness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>‘Oh, that is very likely,’ was the answer.</p>

<p>‘If you do, I’ll take some other and more drastic means
to solve the problem. Officers and men under my control
shall not be done to death with impunity.’</p>

<p>Danevitch was not affected by this display of temper,
and when the subject had been exhausted he withdrew.
He recognised that the case was a difficult one, and, in
view of the fact that the police had exhausted all their
efforts, he was by no means sanguine, although he was of
the opinion that the ordinary methods of the Russian
police were very clumsy, and, in their eagerness to lay their
hands on somebody, and their fossilized belief that the
whole populace was ever engaged in some deep and dark
conspiracy against constituted authority, they often committed
the most ludicrous errors. He never hesitated to
condemn the police methods of his country. He described
them as inartistic, unscientific, and brutal. His outspokenness
on this score made him very unpopular with
the police, and they did not like him to have anything to
do with cases in which they had failed. It is needless to
say this did not disturb him. He had an independent
mind; he worked by his own methods, and he never
allowed himself to be influenced by jealousy or ill-will.</p>

<p>His first step in connection with Colonel Ignatof’s death
was to try and get hold of his private letters and papers,
as he was of opinion that they might furnish him with a
keynote; but he was informed that private documents of
all kinds belonging to the Colonel had passed into the
possession of his nephew, and when the nephew died all his
papers were secured by his executor, who declined to allow
them to be seen by anyone until he himself had gone
through them; for, though he did not give it as his reason,
he was afraid of anything becoming known that might
cause a family scandal. Danevitch next sought an interview
with Alexander Vlassovsky, with whom Captain
Baranoff had dined on the night he met his death.</p>

<p>Vlassovsky was a fashionable young man, and lived in
what was known as the Slobodi quarter, where most of the
wealthy merchants had their villas. The business he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
carried on in the city was that of a stockbroker, and, judging
from his surroundings and the style he kept up, he
was in a flourishing way. He was a bachelor, and made
no secret about it that he was fond of gaiety.</p>

<p>According to the account he gave, he had been acquainted
with Baranoff for a long time, and had lent him
considerable sums of money to enable him to keep up his
extravagances; for though Baranoff’s people were people
of note, and exceedingly proud, they were not rich. At
any rate, the young man was not able to get much from
them, and his pay as a Captain was too small to enable him
to uphold the position he aspired to. Of course, his
financial transactions with Vlassovsky had been kept very
secret, for had they become known to the military authorities,
he would have got into serious trouble.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the relations between the
young men were those of borrower and lender. They
were not friends in the ordinary sense. Indeed, Vlassovsky
remarked to Danevitch with some bitterness:</p>

<p>‘You know, like most young officers, he was as proud as
Lucifer, and seemed to think I was not his equal; though
he was never averse to dine with me and drink wine at my
expense.’</p>

<p>‘Why did he come to you on the night of his death?’</p>

<p>‘To borrow money.’</p>

<p>‘Did you lend him any?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘How much?’</p>

<p>‘Two hundred roubles.’</p>

<p>‘What security did he give you for the various sums
you lent him?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing beyond his acknowledgment.’</p>

<p>‘And you were satisfied with that?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because, if he had failed me at any time, I could have
reported him to the military authorities, and that would
have been his ruin.’</p>

<p>‘But you never had occasion to do that?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>‘No, certainly not.’</p>

<p>‘Did he ever pay you back any of the money he
borrowed?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes.’</p>

<p>‘Where did he get the money from to pay his debts?’</p>

<p>‘How can I tell you that? He did not make me his
confidant.’</p>

<p>‘Did he owe you much at the time of his death?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘How much?’</p>

<p>‘Nearly ten thousand roubles.’</p>

<p>‘That is a large sum! I suppose you will lose it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh dear no!’</p>

<p>‘Why? Did he die worth money?’</p>

<p>‘His life was insured for ten thousand. I hold the
policy and a letter from him to the effect that, should he
die before paying me my due, I was to receive the policy
money.’</p>

<p>‘Have you any idea where he spent his last evening,
after leaving you?’</p>

<p>‘It is known that he went to the opera, because some
acquaintances saw him there.’</p>

<p>‘But after that?’</p>

<p>‘I haven’t the remotest idea.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know nothing of his affairs of gallantry?’</p>

<p>‘Absolutely nothing.’</p>

<p>‘You think, however, that he had lady acquaintances?’</p>

<p>‘I should say there isn’t a doubt about it. He was
wild.’</p>

<p>‘And possibly his death was due to jealousy on the part
of a rival?’</p>

<p>‘Very possibly.’</p>

<p>‘Did you know his uncle?’</p>

<p>‘I did.’</p>

<p>‘Did you accommodate him with money?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, occasionally.’</p>

<p>‘Was he in your debt when he died?’</p>

<p>‘No; he paid me all he owed me a little while before
his death.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>‘Have you any theory to suggest with reference to the
deaths of these two gentlemen?’</p>

<p>‘None whatever.’</p>

<p>‘Were you very much surprised when you heard of the
strange way in which they both died?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t say that I was.’</p>

<p>‘Why were you not?’ asked Danevitch quickly.</p>

<p>‘In the first place, I didn’t know they had been
murdered.’</p>

<p>‘But when you did?’</p>

<p>‘Then I thought they had made themselves obnoxious to
somebody, and the somebody had put them out of the way.’</p>

<p>‘And yet you have no idea who that somebody is?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>Danevitch stopped his questioning at this point. As
he left the house of Alexander Vlassovsky he was of
opinion he had ‘struck a trail’—to quote his own words—and
he began to think out the ways and means of proving
whether he was right or wrong.</p>

<p>In a semi-fashionable quarter of St. Petersburg lived a
lady known generally as Madame Julie St. Joseph. She
was of French origin, but had been a great many years in
Russia. Her husband had carried on business in Moscow
as an engraver and chromo-lithographer. He had been
dead, however, a very long time, and seemed to have passed
from the public mind; but it was vaguely remembered that
he was almost old enough at the time of his death to have
been his wife’s grandfather.</p>

<p>Julie St. Joseph was exceedingly handsome, and at this
period was about forty years of age. She might have
passed, however, for being even younger, as she was remarkably
well preserved, fresh-looking, bright of eye, and
with an abundance of animal spirits, which seemed rather
to indicate the girl than the matured woman. Much
wonder was very naturally expressed that the pretty widow
had remained a widow so long, for, as was well known, she
had had offers of marriage innumerable, and might, had
she been so disposed, have made an excellent match. But
the pretty Julie was fond of gaiety and freedom. As a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
wealthy widow—it was universally believed that she was
wealthy—she could do as she liked, and attract around her
men of all sorts and conditions, and of all ages. They
paid her homage. She held them, so to speak, in her hand;
she could twist them round her fingers. Quarrels about
her were innumerable, and more than one jealous and hot-blooded
fellow had lost his life in a duel of which the
bewitching Julie was the cause.</p>

<p>The style she elected to live in was compatible with the
possession of riches. She kept up a splendid establishment;
her house was sumptuously furnished; she had numerous
servants, many horses. Her winter sledges were renowned
for their luxurious appointments; her summer carriages
were almost unique. She was a woman of the most
sybaritic tastes; and every taste was pandered to and
pampered. Among her servants was a Creole; he was a
man of medium height, though of powerful build, and
with a sullen, morose expression. He was always called
Roko, but of his origin and history nothing was known.
He seemed to be very strongly attached to his mistress,
and always attended her wherever she went; but no man
endowed with the faculty of speech could have been more
silent than he was. He rarely spoke, except when compelled
to answer some question; and it was rumoured that,
like a faithful hound, he slept at his mistress’s door, and
kept watch and ward over her during the hours of night,
while during the day he obeyed her slightest beck or call.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the Russian New Year, and
Madame Julie St. Joseph gave a ball. It was a very grand
ball; everything was done on a lavish scale, and the pomp
and magnificence was almost on a par with a State function.
The people, however, who attended the widow’s festive
gathering could not lay claim to any high social position—at
any rate, not so far as the ladies were concerned. The
ladies who were in the habit of frequenting the pretty
Julie’s salons were of questionable reputations. Julie was
not recognised as a person of social distinction, and in the
female world some rather cruel things were said about her.
The men, however, represented many grades of life: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Army, Navy, Law; the Diplomatic Service; Art, Literature,
the Drama—intellectual Bohemia generally, though
not a few of these men were at considerable pains to conceal
the fact that they visited the charming widow, for, had it
been generally known, their own women-folk might have
protested in a way that would have been anything but
pleasant, and they would have found themselves ostracised
in those higher circles in which many of them moved.
Probably Madame St. Joseph was indifferent to the
opinions of her own sex, so long as she could exact homage
from men; and there could be no two opinions about the
power which she wielded over the sterner sex. It was,
therefore, scarcely matter for wonder that the ladies of
St. Petersburg should feel embittered against her. When
a man is jealous, he takes a rough-and-ready means of
showing his jealousy; if he has a rival, he generally ‘goes
for him,’ and the best man wins. A woman’s jealousy, on
the other hand, finds expression in a different way. In her
bitterness she would sully the reputation of a spotless angel,
and her mother-tongue has no words strong enough wherewith
to express her hatred. No wonder that the old
painters, in depicting jealousy, always took a female as a
model. Of course Madame Julie St. Joseph’s beauty, and
the power it enabled her to wield, made the women very
jealous indeed; but if her female guests lacked quality, the
deficiency was amply compensated for by the high standing
of many of the men. She knew, and was proud of the
fact, that there was hardly a man in Russia, no matter
how exalted his position, that she could not have brought
to her footstool had she desired to do so. Such a woman
was necessarily bound to become notorious and have
numberless enemies. But the widow was beautiful, she
was rich, she gave grand receptions, she spent money
liberally; therefore she had no difficulty in rallying around
her a powerful body of adherents; and, while half St.
Petersburg spoke ill of her, the other half lauded her.</p>

<p>Amongst the guests who attended the ball in question
was a dark-skinned, somewhat peculiar-looking man, said
to be a Polish Count, named Prebenski. He had a heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
moustache and beard, and wore spectacles. As he appeared
to be an entire stranger to the company, the hostess took
him for a time under her wing; but, as he could not or
would not dance, and seemed to find irresistible attraction
in the buffet, where there were unlimited supplies of vodka,
as well as wines of all kinds, she left him to his own devices,
and bestowed the favour of her smiles on more congenial
guests. At length the Count, from the effects, apparently,
of too great a consumption of strong drinks, sought a
quiet nook in an anteroom, and ensconcing himself in a
large chair, sank into a heavy sleep. Some time later,
when the night was growing very old and the grayness of
the winter dawn was beginning to assert itself, and the
guests had dwindled down to a mere handful, Roko, the
Creole, entered the room. Seeing the Count sleeping
there, he paused for a moment as if surprised; then he
shook the guest roughly, but getting no response, save a
grunt, he went away, returning in a few minutes with
another man. That man was Alexander Vlassovsky, who
approached the Count, shook him, called him, and being no
more successful in his efforts to arouse him than Roko had
been, he told Roko to carry him upstairs to a bedroom.
That was done, and the Count was tossed upon a bed and
left there; but before half an hour had passed Vlassovsky
came into the room carrying a small shaded lamp, for
though it was fully daylight heavy curtains were drawn at
the window.</p>

<p>He passed the light of the lamp over the sleeping man’s
eyes, shook him, called him, but as the Count remained unconscious
of these efforts, the intruder placed the lamp on
a small table and, seating himself in a chair by the bedside,
began to search the pockets of the guest. The search
resulted in the production of a miscellaneous collection of
articles, which were duly returned; but at last a pocket-book
was drawn forth; it was opened, and found to contain
a considerable number of bank-notes, representing in the
aggregate a large sum of money. These notes Vlassovsky
took the liberty of transferring to his own pocket, and
replacing the lightened pocket-book, withdrew.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Some hours later Count Prebenski rang the bell in his
room, and in response to the summons Roko appeared,
bearing a lamp. The Count eyed him for some moments
in apparent astonishment, and then asked:</p>

<p>‘Where am I?’</p>

<p>‘In the house of Madame Julie St. Joseph.’</p>

<p>‘What is the hour?’</p>

<p>‘It is three o’clock.’</p>

<p>‘In the morning?’</p>

<p>‘No. The afternoon.’ Roko drew the curtains, and
revealed the bright, steel-coloured winter sky, tinged a
little towards the horizon with a flush of red.</p>

<p>The Count seemed puzzled. He stared first at the sky,
then at the Creole.</p>

<p>‘How is it I am here?’ he asked.</p>

<p>Roko revealed all his gleaming teeth as he grinned in reply.</p>

<p>‘How is it I am here?’ repeated the Count, peremptorily
and hotly.</p>

<p>‘Your Excellency indulged too freely in liquor, and we
had to put you to bed.’</p>

<p>‘Umph!’ mused the Count; ‘it was kind; now, tell me,
did your mistress, Madame St. Joseph, know of my condition?’</p>

<p>‘She did.’</p>

<p>‘Was she angry?’</p>

<p>‘Well, Excellency, she certainly wasn’t pleased.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! I fear I have made a bea—— a fool of myself.
Give me the wherewith to put myself in a presentable condition,
and I will see madam. By the way, has she risen yet?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes.’</p>

<p>‘Good; as soon as I have performed my toilet, return
here and conduct me to your mistress.’</p>

<p>Roko bowed and withdrew. In half an hour he came
back again, and, followed by the Count, led the way to
Madame St. Joseph’s boudoir, a very comfortable little
retreat, daintily furnished, cosy and bright with knick-knacks,
cushions, curtains, luxurious rugs, and warmed to
the high temperature beloved of Russians by means of a
polished metal radiating stove. Dressed in a most elegant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
fur-trimmed dressing-gown, madame was stretched upon a
divan. Beside her was a Moorish table, on which stood
coffee and cigarettes. She was smoking as the Count
entered. Without rising, she extended her delicate white
hand to him, and, smiling sweetly, said:</p>

<p>‘Pray be seated, Count. Roko, pour out some coffee.
Will you take vodka or cognac with it, Count?’</p>

<p>The Count chose vodka, and his wants having been
supplied, the lady bade Roko retire.</p>

<p>‘I owe you an apology, madame,’ began the Count. ‘I
forgot myself last night. It was good of you to take care
of me. I am deeply indebted to you for your hospitality.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, a mere trifle,’ smiled the lady. ‘My faithful slave
found you asleep in a chair, and as his efforts failed to
awaken you, he carried you upstairs by my orders.’</p>

<p>At this point in the conversation the door opened, and
Vlassovsky appeared on the threshold; but seeing that
madame had a visitor, he quickly withdrew.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry to say I am the victim of a strange weakness,’
answered the Count. ‘I am a temperate man, but
should I be tempted to indulge beyond my ordinary allowance
it throws me into a sort of coma, from which I only
recover after many hours of death-like sleep.’</p>

<p>‘You are to be pitied, Count.’</p>

<p>‘Your pity is worth having,’ he answered. ‘Now, tell
me, madame, what penalty am I to pay for having so far
forgotten myself?’</p>

<p>‘Penalty, Count!’</p>

<p>‘Yes. I am wealthy. Money is no object to me. I
have notes. I am almost alone in the world.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed!’ exclaimed the lady, with animation, and regarding
her guest with new-born interest; ‘you are fortunate.
I presume you are staying here temporarily?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. I am travelling for my pleasure. When our
mutual friend Trepoff was good enough to ask you to
extend your courtesy to me, and sent me an invitation to
your ball, I accepted it with pleasure, and was glad to
leave the loneliness of my hotel; but it grieves me sorely
to think that I so forgot myself.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>‘Pray, Count, do not let the matter give you any concern,’
said the charming widow, as she sat up and again
extended her soft hand to him to kiss. ‘Are you likely
to remain in St. Petersburg long?’</p>

<p>‘My stay will be regulated by the amount of pleasure
I experience here. But a hotel is not the most comfortable
place in the winter, and I confess I feel dull and
lonely.’</p>

<p>The lady fixed her keen eyes upon him as she remarked:</p>

<p>‘Indeed, I can well understand that, Count. Now, if I
might venture to ask you to make my poor abode your
residence during your stay in the city, it would afford me
great pleasure to play the hostess. Will you accept of
my hospitality?’</p>

<p>‘Really, Madame St. Joseph, I, I——’</p>

<p>‘Pray, no thanks or excuses, Count; the pleasure is
mine, and I will endeavour at least to prevent your suffering
from ennui.’</p>

<p>The Count rose, and warmly pressing her hand, said he
was overwhelmed by her goodness, and no less enchanted
with her beauty. He accepted her invitation in the spirit,
in which it was given, and without losing any time would
hasten to his hotel, pay his bill, and remove his things at
once to madame’s house. An hour later he drove up in a
drosky with his luggage, and was conducted to the handsomest
of the guest-chambers. That night he dined <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with madame, and in the course of the dinner he
told her that the previous night he managed to lose, or
had been relieved of, in some way, a large sum of money.
When she uttered exclamations of regret, and expressed
her sympathy with him, he laughed carelessly, made light
of his loss, and said that, large though the sum was, it
gave him no real concern, and he would regard it as a fine
he had paid for his rudeness.</p>

<p>The widow sighed and told him he was a fortunate man
in being able to bear such a loss without feeling it.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed, and the Count found himself in
comfortable quarters. As if desirous of monopolizing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
company, the widow invited nobody to the house, and
those who paid the ordinary courtesy calls she speedily
dismissed; while gentlemen who had been in the habit of
dropping in of an evening to play cards and sup with
pretty Julie were told by Roko that she was suffering so
much from the fatigues of the ball that she could see no
one. One caller, Peter Trepoff, who came specially to
inquire about the Count, was told that though he had
been there he had departed, without saying where he was
going to. All that fortnight she remained very secluded.
She would not accompany the Count when he invited her
to go out, and she so strongly persuaded him not to go
that he yielded and remained indoors. Every fascination,
every talent she possessed, she put forth and exerted to
amuse and entertain him, until he was as pliable as clay in
her hands. One night he had retired to rest, and had
been in his room about an hour, when he heard the handle
of his door move. The door was not locked; indeed,
there was no key wherewith to lock it, and he had not
concerned himself about it in any way. Very gently, and
almost without a sound, the latch was raised and the door
pushed open. Presently Roko entered on his hands and
knees. He paused and listened. Certain nasal sounds
seemed to indicate that the Count was sleeping very
soundly. Roko carried a tiny little lantern, and he flashed
a ray across the sleeper’s face. Having satisfied himself
that the Count was asleep, he drew from his pocket a
phial containing a colourless liquid, and, approaching a
night-table, on which stood a jug of barley-tea, which the
Count had in his room every night, as he said it had been
his custom for years always to drink barley-tea in the
night-time, the Creole poured the contents of the phial
into the jug, and having done that, he withdrew as
stealthily as he had entered. Soon afterwards the Count
rose, procured a light, and took from his portmanteau a
large flask, into which he emptied the barley-tea. Then
he addressed himself to sleep again, and slept the sleep of
the just.</p>

<p>At the usual morning meal he did not put in an appearance;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
but he sent a request to madame, asking her to
be good enough to come and see him. The request was
speedily complied with. When she appeared she looked as
charming and as radiant as ever. He was profuse in his
apologies for having troubled her to come to his room, but
pleaded as an excuse a feeling of extreme illness. She
displayed great anxiety and concern, and wanted to send
for a doctor; but he told her it was nothing. He thought
something had disagreed with him; that was all. It would
pass off. A doctor was not needed. She declared, however,
that if he felt no better in an hour’s time she would insist
on his seeing a doctor. An hour slipped by, and he was
still in the same condition, so a messenger was despatched
for a doctor, who speedily put in an appearance.</p>

<p>To the doctor’s inquiries, the patient said he believed he
had eaten or drunk something which had upset him. The
doctor was of the same opinion, and prescribed accordingly.
In the course of the afternoon the Count said he felt somewhat
better, and though the hostess tried to dissuade him
from doing so, he announced his intention of going out to
get a breath of fresh air. He wanted her to accompany
him. That she stoutly refused to do; and when she saw
he was determined to go she withdrew her opposition, and
expressed a hope that he would speedily return. He
assured her that he would do so. He said he was going to
have a drive in a sledge on the Neva for two or three hours.
Having put on his Shuba, his fur gloves, fur-lined boots,
and fur cap, he took his departure.</p>

<p>After an absence of about three hours, he returned, and
declared that he felt much better. He spent about an hour
with the lady in her boudoir, then retired. She was very
anxious that Roko should sit up with him, but he resolutely
set his face against that, saying that there was not the least
necessity for it. He was an exceedingly sound sleeper, and
he was sure he would sleep as soundly as usual. About
midnight his door was opened silently, as on the previous
night, and once again Roko crept stealthily to the bed-table,
and emptied the contents of a phial into the barley-tea.
Soon after he had withdrawn the Count jumped up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
poured the tea into another flask, which he produced from
his portmanteau, and then lay down in the bed again until
a neighbouring church clock solemnly and slowly tolled
out two o’clock. Almost immediately the Count rose, and
dressed himself. That done, he took from his portmanteau
a revolver, and having examined it to ascertain if it was
properly loaded, he lighted a lantern provided with a
shutter, to shut off the light when required. Going to the
door, he opened it gently, and listened. All was silent.
There wasn’t a sound, save that made by the wind, which
whistled mournfully through the corridor. Having satisfied
himself that nothing human was stirring, the Count proceeded
cautiously along the corridor, descended a short
flight of stairs to another corridor, along which he passed,
and gained the main door that gave access to the street.
He opened this door, though not without some difficulty,
as there were bolts and chains to be undone, and he worked
cautiously for fear of making a noise.</p>

<p>At last all obstacles were removed, and the heavy door
swung on its hinges, letting in a blast of icy air, and revealing
the brilliant stars that burned like jewels in the
cloudless black sky. In a few minutes eight men filed into
the house noiselessly, and the door was closed, but chains
and bolts were left undone. The men exchanged a few
sentences in whispers. Then, following the Count, they
proceeded to the sleeping apartment of Madame Julie St.
Joseph. In an anteroom, through which it was necessary
to pass to reach her room, Roko, enveloped in furs, lay on
a couch, locked in sleep. A shaded lamp stood on a bracket
against the wall.</p>

<p>Four men remained in this room; the other four and
the Count entered the lady’s chamber. Here, again, a
shaded lamp burned on a bracket, and close to it an ikon—or
sacred picture—hung. The pretty widow was also
sleeping. By this time the Count had undergone a strange
transformation. His beard and moustache had disappeared,
revealing the smooth-shaved, mobile face of Michael Danevitch,
the detective. He shook the lady. With a start
she awoke. The four policemen had concealed themselves;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Danevitch alone was visible. It was some moments
before madame realized the situation; then, seeing a strange
man by her bedside, she uttered a cry, and called for Roko.
He sprang up, and instantly found himself in the grip of
two stalwart men, while the revolver under his pillow,
which he tried to get, was seized.</p>

<p>‘Madame Julie St. Joseph,’ said Danevitch, ‘get up and
dress yourself.’</p>

<p>‘What does this mean?’ she asked, with a look of alarm
on her pretty face, as she thrust her hand under the pillow,
where she likewise had a revolver concealed. But in an
instant Danevitch had seized her wrist in his powerful
grasp, and one of his colleagues removed the weapon.</p>

<p>‘It means,’ he answered, ‘that your career of infamy has
come to an end. You are under arrest.’</p>

<p>A look of terror and horror swept across her face as she
asked in a choked sort of voice:</p>

<p>‘On what grounds am I arrested?’</p>

<p>‘That you will learn later on. Sufficient for you to
know that you are a prisoner. Come, rise and dress
yourself.’</p>

<p>She recognised the hopelessness of resistance, and, of
course, she understood that her faithful watch-hound
Roko had been rendered powerless. She was trapped;
that she knew. But it did not dawn upon her then that
the Count and Danevitch were one and the same. Consequently
she was puzzled to understand how her downfall
had been brought about.</p>

<p>With a despairing sigh she rose and put on her clothes.
Half an hour later she was being conveyed to the gaol
with Roko, accompanied by Danevitch and three of his
colleagues. The other five had been left in charge of the
house. When madame had somewhat recovered her presence
of mind, she assumed a bravado which she was far from
feeling, and asked Danevitch airily if he knew how her
guest the Count was.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ answered Danevitch. ‘He is perfectly well,
as you may judge for yourself; for I it was who played
the part of the Count so effectively.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>With an absolute scream madame bit her lip with passion,
until the blood flowed, and dug her nails into the palms of
her hands.</p>

<p>‘What a fool, a dolt, an idiot I’ve been! But tell
me, how was it Peter Trepoff asked me to invite you to
the ball?’</p>

<p>‘Peter Trepoff is my agent, madame.’</p>

<p>With a suppressed cry of maddening rage, the wretched
woman covered her face with her hands and groaned, as
she realized how thoroughly she had been outwitted.</p>

<p>That same night, or, rather, some hours before the widow
and Roko were swept into the net which had been so
cleverly prepared for them, Alexander Vlassovsky was
arrested in Moscow. Danevitch learned that fact by
telegraph when he went out in the afternoon. He had
first begun to suspect Vlassovsky after that interview when
he was making inquiries about the death of Captain
Baranoff. The result was that he intercepted letters from
Madame Julie St. Joseph, who had returned to St. Petersburg.
She had a small house in Moscow, which she occasionally
visited in order to secure victims. In Moscow,
where he was well known, the wily Vlassovsky did not go
near her, but he helped her as far as he could in her
fiendish work. He had been very cleverly trapped by the
notes which he relieved the supposed Count of. Those
notes were not genuine, and when he attempted to pass
them he was arrested, for Danevitch had notified the
Moscow police.</p>

<p>Subsequent revelations brought to light that the
wretched woman had been in the habit of luring men to
their doom by means of her fatal beauty. She bled them
of their money, her plan being to cajole them into giving
her a lien on any property they might possess. This was
most artfully worked by the aid of Vlassovsky, and when
the victim had been securely caught, he was poisoned.
The poisons were concocted by Madame St. Joseph herself,
and when she could not do it herself, Roko administered
the fatal dose or doses. She had picked up this man in
Spanish America, where she had been for some time, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
weaving her spell about him, had made him absolutely her
slave.</p>

<p>Vlassovsky, who, up to the time that he made her acquaintance,
had been an honest, industrious man, fell under
the magic of her influence, as most men did, and became
her all-too-willing tool. His nature once corrupted, all
scruples were thrown to the winds, and he hastened to try
and enrich himself. It seemed that the miserable woman
really loved him, and though he was fatally fascinated
with her, he was afraid of her; and, as he confessed, his
aim was to accumulate money as quickly as possible, and
then flee from her and the country for ever. But unfortunately
for himself, during that memorable interview following
Captain Baranoff’s death, he had aroused the suspicions
of Danevitch, whose marvellous perceptive faculties had
enabled him to detect something or another in Vlassovsky’s
manner, or answers to the questions put to him, which
made him suspicious. For Danevitch to become suspicious
meant that he would never rest until he had proved his
suspicions justified or unfounded.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that with her arrest in St.
Petersburg Madame St. Joseph’s career came to an end.
From the moment that Danevitch entered her house her
doom was sealed. Believing him to be the person he
represented himself to be, she begged of him to help her
financially; and, seeming to yield to her entreaties, he
drew up a document which purported to make over to her
at his death certain estates in Poland. Of course, these
estates had no existence. Having secured him, as she
thought, her next step was to poison him by small doses of
black hellebore, so that he might gradually sicken and die.
Her devilish cunning was evidenced in every step she took.
She would not appear in public with him, nor did she
allow any of the visitors to her house to see him. Consequently
it would not be generally known that she had
associated with him. As his illness developed by means
of repeated doses, she would have had him removed to a
hotel, and she knew pretty well that, as in Colonel
Ignatof’s case, he would shrink from letting it be known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
that he had been intimate with her. Her cunning, however,
overreached itself; she was defeated with her own
weapons; Danevitch had been too much for her. The
poisoned barley-tea he submitted to analysis, and the evidence
against her was overwhelming. But when she found
that there was no hope, she was determined to defeat
justice, and one morning she was found dead in her cell:
she had poisoned herself with prussic acid. The acid was
conveyed to her by a warder, who was heavily bribed by
one of her friends to do it. It cost him his liberty, however,
for he was sent to Northern Siberia for the term of
his natural life.</p>

<p>Roko died very soon afterwards from typhoid fever contracted
in the prison, but he was faithful to the last, for
never a word could be wrung from his lips calculated to
incriminate the strange woman who had thrown such a
spell around him. Vlassovsky was deported to Northern
Siberia in company with the treacherous warder. He
very soon succumbed, however, to the awful hardships he
was called upon to endure and the rigours of the Arctic
climate.</p>

<p>The number of Madame St. Joseph’s victims was never
determined. That they were numerous there was not the
slightest doubt; and had it not been for the cleverness of
Danevitch she would probably have continued to pursue
her infamous career for years longer, and ultimately have
passed away in the odour of sanctity. Her downfall, it
need scarcely be said, caused great satisfaction in St.
Petersburg and Moscow, where she had destroyed so many
of her victims.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE STRANGE STORY OF AN ATTACHÉ.</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> can readily be understood that Danevitch led not only
an active life, but a varied one; and the cases he was
called upon to deal with revealed many remarkable phases
of human nature. He never attempted to pose as a
moralist, but he frequently deplored the fact that wickedness
and evil should so largely predominate over goodness.
He was also apt to wax indignant against the vogue to
decry anything in the nature of sensation. He was in the
habit of saying that life from the cradle to the grave is
full of sensations, and that the inventions of the fictionist
are poor, flat, and stale, when compared with the realities
of existence. But this is undoubtedly the experience of
everyone who knows the world and his kind. It is only
the cheap critic, the bigot, or the fool, who has the boldness
to deny the existence of sensation in real life, and to
sneer at what he is pleased to term melodramatic improbabilities.
There is no such thing as a melodramatic improbability.
The only charge that can legitimately be
levelled at the so-called sensational writer is his tendency
to grotesque treatment of subjects which should simply be
faithful reproductions from life. The curious story of
young Count Dashkoff, the Russian attaché, with whom
this narrative is concerned, illustrates in a very forcible
way the views advanced in the foregoing lines. Indeed,
as Danevitch himself says, if anyone had invented the
story and put it into print, he would have raised the ire
of the army of critics—the self-constituted high-priests of
purity, who, being unable to improve or even equal that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
which they condemn, are all the more violent in their condemnation.</p>

<p>Count Dashkoff was a young man, a member of a very
old Russian family, who had in their day wielded great
power, and before the abolition of serfdom took place,
had held sway over more serfs than any other family in the
whole of the empire. The Count had distinguished himself
in many ways. His career, up to the time of the
extraordinary events about to be recorded, had been
marked by brilliancy and shade. As a student and a
scholar he had attracted the attention of many notable
men, more particularly by his well-known and remarkable
work, entitled ‘The Theory of Creation,’ which is conspicuous
for its erudition, its deep research, and its wide
grasp and clever treatment of a tremendous subject. The
book is, and will ever remain, a standard, and consequently
an enduring monument to the Count’s ability and industry.
On the other hand, he had made himself notorious by
certain excesses, and a recklessness of conduct which had
shocked the proprieties and outraged the feelings of those
who were interested in him and hoped that he would ultimately
rise to power and position. Of course, excuses
were forthcoming on the grounds of his youth, and, as if
trying to establish a right by two wrongs, it was urged
that he had simply done what most Russian youths do
who are born to high estate and have control of wealth.
As a stepping-stone to the future greatness predicted for
him by his friends, the Count, after a probationary course
in the diplomatic service at home, was sent as an attaché
to the Russian Embassy in Paris. As might be supposed,
he took kindly to Parisian life. He was what is usually
termed an elegant young man, with æsthetic tastes. When
he first went to Paris he was about eight-and-twenty, and,
apart from the advantages of youth, he had wealth, good
looks, sound health, and a cheerful disposition. He enjoyed
life, and showed no disposition to mortify the flesh
by an austere or monastic régime. His private residence
in the Champs Élysées was conspicuous for the magnificence
of its appointments, and was the rendezvous of the élite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of Paris society—that frivolous section which lives for no
higher purpose than to live, and is attracted to wealth and
luxury as bees are attracted to sugar. It seemed that this
apparently fortunate young man, who could be serious
enough when occasion required, was fond of attention and
homage. He loved to be surrounded with a crowd of
admirers, who flattered him, praised his bric-à-brac, and
gorged themselves with the good things he invariably set
before them. He knew, no doubt, that they were all
fawners and sycophants, but, still, they made up a little
world over which he ruled, and wherever he led the noodles
would follow.</p>

<p>Two years of this sort of life passed, and then Danevitch
was instructed to proceed with all haste from Russia to try
and discover what had become of the Count, for he had
suddenly and mysteriously disappeared, and all efforts of
the Paris police and the boasted skill of the Parisian
detectives had failed to reveal a trace of him. The facts
of the case were as follows: In the course of the month of
January the Count gave a grand ball and reception at his
elegant hotel, and the event drew together the gilded
youth of both sexes. These functions at the Count’s residence
were always marked by a magnificence of splendour
and a lavish expenditure which seemed hardly consonant
with his position as a mere attaché. But it must not be
forgotten that he was the heir to great wealth, and represented
a noble family who had ever been distinguished for
the almost regal style in which they lived.</p>

<p>About two o’clock in the morning the Count drew an
intimate friend of his—a Monsieur Eugène Peon—on one
side, and told him he wanted to slip away for an hour, but
he did not wish it to be known that he had gone out. He
would be sure to be back in about an hour, he added. A
few minutes later the concierge saw him leave the hall.
He was attired in a very handsome and costly fur coat,
with a cap to match; and though the weather was bitterly
cold and the ground covered with snow, he wore patent-leather
shoes. The concierge, who was much surprised at
the fact of his master leaving the house in the midst of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
revels, asked him if he wanted a carriage. To this question
the Count answered curtly, and, according to the porter,
angrily, ‘No.’ The night wore itself out. The dancers
danced themselves into limpness and prostration, and
began to depart. Some surprise had been expressed at the
Count’s absence, and various inquiries had been made about
him; but it was suggested that the seductive influences of
the wine-cup had proved too much for him, and he had
retired. This hint or suggestion appeared to satisfy the
light-headed revellers, who gave no further thought to the
matter. His friend, Eugène Peon, considered it very
strange that the Count should go away and remain away
in such a manner, to the neglect of his guests, for he
was the most punctilious host. But Peon set it down to
an assignation, and thought that he had found the society
of some fair one more attractive than the glitter and glare
of the ballroom. The day had very well advanced before
there was anything like real surprise felt at the Count’s
prolonged absence.</p>

<p>It appeared that Eugène Peon called at his friend’s hotel
soon after three o’clock in the afternoon, and, ascertaining
that he was not at home, went down to the Embassy to
inquire for him there, but to his astonishment was informed
that the Count had not been there for two days. Although
astonished, Peon was not uneasy. He stated that he saw
no cause to be uneasy, although he had never known his
friend do such a thing before, and was aware that he was
most attentive to his duties. When he called again on the
following morning, however, and was informed that the
Count was still absent, he began then to fear that something
was wrong, and he at once communicated his fears to
some of the Count’s close personal friends; he had no relations
in Paris at all. A consultation was held, but there
seem to have been divided counsels, and no steps were taken
to ascertain the Count’s whereabouts, though some inquiries
were made of the members of the household, but all that
could be elicited was that the concierge saw his master go
out about two o’clock, and that he was dressed in patent-leather
boots, a heavy fur coat, and a fur cap. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
tone in which he said ‘No,’ when asked if he wanted a
carriage, he appeared to be angry; but there was no indication
in his gait or speech that he was under the influence
of wine. It was not until another whole day had
passed that anything like real alarm had set in. The
alarm by this time had reached the Embassy, and it was
decided that the police should be communicated with.
Strangely enough, the police did not at first attach any
serious importance to the matter. They made certain
inquiries in a perfunctory manner, and for some inscrutable
reason—unless it was sheer, downright pig-headedness, a
quality often enough conspicuous in the French police—they
came to the conclusion that ‘Monsieur le Comte’ had
been guilty of some little escapade, and would turn up very
shortly. As this prediction had not been fulfilled when
another twenty-four hours had elapsed, a much more
serious view was taken of the young man’s absence, and
dark hints were let drop that he had been inveigled into
one of the haunts of vice which abound in the gay city,
and had been murdered. The murder theory was at once
taken up; detectives were communicated with, and the
theory of murder found general acceptance.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, a gentleman, who by reason of his
position and his riches had cut a conspicuous figure in
society, disappearing suddenly in this way was bound to
cause a sensation, and as the Parisians dearly love a sensation
and a scandal, the matter was a fruitful topic of conversation
for several days, while much ink was expended
over it by the journalists. But notwithstanding the publicity
given to the matter, and the efforts of police and
detectives, another week passed, and not a trace or sign of
the missing man had been obtained.</p>

<p>Up to this point the Count’s relatives in Russia had not
been communicated with, from a desire to avoid alarm, for
there were those who still hoped he would turn up again
all right; but now his Russian friends in Paris regarded
the affair as too serious to be longer withheld. As a preliminary,
a message was at once sent asking if the Count
had returned home, and almost simultaneously with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
despatch of that message a courier set out for Russia with
the tidings and details.</p>

<p>As the Count—as far as was known—had not returned
to Russia, great consternation was caused amongst his
friends by the report that reached them, and no time was
lost in securing the services of Danevitch, who was instructed
to leave for Paris without a moment’s delay, and
institute independent inquiries.</p>

<p>‘I found, on arriving in the French capital,’ says Danevitch,
‘that by order of the Russian Ambassador all the
Count’s things had been sealed up and his house temporarily
closed. My preliminary investigations were directed to
trying to discover if there were any grounds for believing
that the missing man had committed suicide. This inquiry
was necessarily forced upon one—at any rate upon me,
although I learnt that the possibilities of suicide had never
entered the heads of the French police. And though at
first they had suggested murder, they soon abandoned that
idea, for no other reason, as it appeared, than that they
had not been able to find his body. And in consequence
of this they insisted that he had taken himself off to some
other country in order to avoid the results of conduct unbecoming
a gentleman and a member of the Embassy.
When they were asked to give a name to his conduct, they
declined, but darkly hinted at something very dreadful. I
myself could find no grounds for the theory of suicide,
while everyone at the Embassy, as well as all who knew
him, indignantly repudiated the slur which was sought to
be cast upon the young gentleman’s character. I could
find no one who had a word to say against his honour.
That he might have had <i>affaires d’amour</i>, as the French call
them, was readily admitted; but as all is considered fair in
love, as in war, these matters were not supposed to reflect
on the honour of a man.</p>

<p>‘As Monsieur Eugène Peon had been very intimate with
the Count, I questioned that gentleman very closely concerning
his friend’s movements, and elicited that he had
been a pretty general lover, but, so far as he knew, the
Count had formed no serious attachment to anybody.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Peon could suggest no reason why the Count should have
left his guests so abruptly, unless it was to keep an assignation.</p>

<p>‘Now, it must be remembered that when he left his
house it was about two o’clock on a winter morning, and,
according to the concierge, he seemed angry when he went
out. This seemed to me to point to two things as absolutely
certain. Firstly, the Count’s going out at such an
hour was not premeditated. Secondly, whatever appointment
he went to keep, it was not an agreeable one to him,
and, being annoyed, he displayed his irritation in the sharp
answer he gave the concierge. These points seemed to me
of great importance, and naturally led me to an inquiry
directed to finding out if one of his servants had delivered
any message to him, or conveyed any letter during the
evening.</p>

<p>‘The servants had been dismissed, and it was not an easy
matter to reach them all; but by persevering I succeeded
in doing so, and found at last that the Count’s body-servant,
a Frenchman, named Auguste Chauzy, had been
out all the evening, after having dressed his master, and
knowing that he would not be wanted again until the
morning. He returned, however, soon after midnight, and
just as he was about to enter the house, a man stepped up
to him hurriedly, and, putting a sealed envelope into his
hand, said, “Give that immediately to your master, Count
Dashkoff. Fail not to do so, as it is a matter of life and
death.”</p>

<p>‘When Chauzy got into the hall, he glanced at the
envelope, and saw that it simply bore the Count’s name—no
address; but in the left-hand corner was the French
word <i>Pressant</i> (Urgent) underlined. The valet could not
get near his master for some time after this, but as soon as
an opportunity occurred to do so, he handed him the note.
The moment the Count’s eye caught the superscription, a
frown settled on his face, and, with a gesture of annoyance,
he thrust the letter unopened in his pocket. About half
an hour later, however, the valet was informed by another
servant that the Count required his fur coat and cap.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
They were to be placed in his dressing-room ready for
him.</p>

<p>‘I questioned Chauzy about the man who had handed
him the letter in the street; but the only description he
could give of him was that he seemed to be well dressed,
was of medium height, and had a dark beard and
moustache.’</p>

<p>Having brought to light the fact about the letter,
Danevitch struck a keynote, as it were—and one which
had not been touched upon by the French police. If that
letter could have been found, it might have revealed much;
but it was almost certain that if the Count did not destroy
it before leaving the house he had it in his pocket when he
went out. Danevitch’s deduction from the letter incident
was this: The Count went out owing to some communication
made to him in that letter. He did not go willingly;
consequently his errand was a disagreeable one, and could
hardly have been to keep a love tryst. Whoever the
writer of the letter was, he or she must have had some
powerful hold on the Count to induce him to leave his
friends and guests, and go out at two o’clock on a bitter
winter morning. This line of reasoning was one which
Danevitch could not avoid, for it was his wont to argue
his subject from a given set of premises, and a strict regard
for probabilities. He was led—and it was but natural
he should be—to the conclusion that the Count’s disappearance
was due to conduct which had brought him in
contact with unscrupulous people, into whose power he
had fallen. It was clear that if he was still living he was
forcibly detained somewhere or other, and was in such
a position that he could not communicate with those who
were so anxious about him. If this was not the case, it
was hard to understand why he should have remained
silent, knowing well enough the anxiety and distress his
prolonged absence would cause. The other hypothesis
was—the idea of suicide not being entertained—that he
had been murdered. If that was the case, the motive for
the murder was either revenge or robbery. It seemed
almost absurd to think of robbery, for this reason: it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
hardly likely that anyone would have chosen such an
inopportune moment; for, at two o’clock in the morning,
and entertaining a house full of guests, he would scarcely
have much valuable property on his person. If he had
been murdered, the crime had been prompted by feelings
of revenge, and committed by someone who believed he
had a deadly grievance against the young man—a grievance
that could only be compensated for by the shedding of the
Count’s blood.</p>

<p>It was impossible to ignore what, on the face of it,
seemed to be a fact—that the writer of the letter was
personally acquainted with the Count, and possessed knowledge
which placed a weapon in his hand. Of course, the
Count’s friends wouldn’t listen for a moment to any
suggestion that he had been guilty of conduct unbecoming
a gentleman, and, having discovered that, Danevitch
kept his views to himself; though he closely questioned
Eugène Peon, who, while admitting that he had had
numerous little adventures with the Count, declared that
these adventures were only those which a young, handsome,
and rich man would engage in, and while they might be
described as foolish and reckless, they were never of a
nature to reflect upon his honour. They were, in short,
simply the follies and venial sins of youth, such as were
common, in a greater or lesser degree, to all young men.
Nothing further than this could be elicited from Peon,
who appeared to be a reserved and reticent person, giving
Danevitch the impression that he always had something in
reserve—that he had an <i>arrière pensée</i>, and would not tell
more than it suited him to tell. At any rate, he declined
to suggest any theory that would account for his friend’s
sudden and mysterious disappearance.</p>

<p>‘Do you not know if he had any serious love affair?’
asked Danevitch with some sharpness, as he came to the
conclusion that Peon was not as candid as he ought to be.</p>

<p>‘I don’t,’ answered Peon emphatically.</p>

<p>‘But surely, intimate as you were with him, you must
know something of your friend’s little gallantries?’</p>

<p>‘I do not, beyond what I have told you.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Peon gave this answer with a sharpness and decisiveness
which made it clear that he would not submit to pumping,
and would not be drawn on the subject of his friend’s
amours.</p>

<p>During the time that Danevitch was searching for a clue—without
avail up to this stage—the Count’s friends did
not remain inactive. Necessarily, they were impatient, and
grew more restless as the weeks sped by without bringing
any tidings of the missing man. The police confessed
themselves baffled, and seemed to be at a loss to suggest
a feasible theory, and they urged the friends to offer a
substantial reward for information that would lead to the
discovery of the Count if living, and a lesser reward for his
body if dead. The friends yielded, and intimated that
they would pay ten thousand francs for the Count’s
recovery living, or five thousand for his body. The police
quite believed this reward would have the desired effect,
and that they would be relieved from an embarrassing
situation. Of course, the human water-rats who haunt
the Seine kept a very sharp look-out indeed, and every
corpse that they dragged from the foul and reeking waters
of the sluggish river was eagerly scrutinized in the hope
that it would turn out to be the body of the missing
Count. But though it was reported several times that the
dead Count had been fished out of the river, the report, on
investigation, proved to be false. Nor did the offer of the
ten thousand francs prove more potent. Not a trace of
the missing man was discovered.</p>

<p>This failure of the substantial reward to bring forth any
tidings confirmed Danevitch in the opinion he had formed
that the Count’s disappearance was the result of some plot,
and those engaged in it were in a position which rendered
them indifferent to the reward. This did not imply that
the detective considered it a certainty that the Count was
living. On the contrary, he inclined to the belief that he
had been murdered, but, necessarily, the murderers could
not produce his body for fear of betraying themselves. In
his own way, Danevitch worked away quietly and unostentatiously.
He was perfectly convinced that the clue to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the mystery would be found in the habits of the Count, or
among some of his possessions. But the friends in Paris
opposed strong objections to any exhaustive search of his
effects being made, influenced thereby, no doubt, by a fear
of anything being made public calculated to reflect on the
missing man’s honour. This supersensitiveness was annoying,
and at last Danevitch applied to the relatives in
Russia, and asked them to give a peremptory order for
him to be allowed to go through the Count’s papers. In
response to this application, the Count’s father came at
once to Paris, and took possession of everything belonging
to his son, and he and Danevitch went through the papers
together. There was a mass of official correspondence and
business letters, but very few private letters, except those
from his parents and his near relatives, and love letters
from a young lady residing in Russia. She was of high
family, and well known to the Count’s people, who hoped
that he would ultimately make her his wife, as in every
way the match was a desirable one. The letters evinced a
very strong attachment on the lady’s part, and were in
many instances couched in warm, even extravagant, phrases
of love. But there was nothing in them calculated to
throw light on the mystery. She knew of her lover’s disappearance,
and was prostrated with grief and anxiety, so
the Count’s father asserted.</p>

<p>The result of the examination of the papers so far was
very disappointing, but a small diary was found in which
were some rather remarkable passages. It was not a diary
of doings and events from day to day, but seemed to be
the outpourings of the writer’s feelings and emotions,
written in a fitful and irregular manner. Those which
struck Danevitch the most were as follows:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘I often wonder whether we are really free and responsible
beings; whether the evil we do is the result of
deliberate sinning, or whether it is due to some inward
promptings which we are absolutely powerless to resist.
If the latter, to what extent can we be held liable for our
sins? I am sorely troubled at times with this thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
and yearn for someone to whom I could appeal with a
hope of receiving such an answer as would seem to me
satisfactory. The teachings of my Church do not satisfy
me. The Church says that to do evil is to incur the
wrath of Heaven; but if I cannot resist doing evil, is it
right that I should be held responsible? Of course, the
world would say that this is sophistry, but when I find
myself on the one hand trying with all my might to avoid
doing anything which, according to the laws of ethics and
the canons of the Church, could be construed into wrong-doing,
and, on the other, being drawn by some vaguely
defined power, which I am too weak to resist, into doing
that which I am conscious it is not right to do, I ask
myself if I can really be held responsible. It seems to
me that I have two distinct characters, clearly separated,
and entirely antagonistic to each other. The one leads
me into paths that I would fain avoid; the other causes
me to weep for my frailty. I wonder if all men are constituted
like this? Perhaps they are, but are less sensitive
than I am.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘If a man entangles himself in a net, he may exhaust
himself in his struggles to get free again, and it may even
be that the more he struggles the more tightly he may
enmesh himself, until he realizes the horror that he is
doomed to remain powerless until death itself releases him.
This is figurative language, but it is by such language that
we can best convey our true meaning. It is but speaking
in parables, and parables better than anything else often
enable us to understand and grasp what would otherwise
be obscure. Unhappily, I am entangled in a net, and I
have struggled in vain to free myself. If I could undo the
past, I might know true happiness once more; but that
which is done is done, and though we weep tears of blood,
we can never obliterate the record which is written on the
tablets of memory. I wonder what the pure being in
Russia, to whom I gave my heart, would say if she knew
how I had wronged her. Can I ever look into her clear
honest eyes again with the frank, unflinching gaze of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
happy days past and gone? I fear not. Indeed, I feel that
I dare not meet her again. I have dug a gulf between us,
and that gulf can never be bridged. But I suffer agony
of mind when I think how she will suffer when she knows
my baseness, as know she must, sooner or later. It is hard
to have to live two lives, as I am doing. To my friends I
appear all they would believe me to be; but in the solitude
of my chamber my heart bleeds as I realize how false
I am.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘I have been weak, but am growing strong again.
Desperation is lending me strength, in fact; and I shall
burst these accursed bonds asunder. I have still youth
and energy, and must make an effort to climb to higher
heights. I have been walking blindly hitherto, and have
missed my way, but I see it clear enough now; and a
resolute and determined man, who finds himself surrounded
by obstacles, should sweep them away. He who hesitates
is lost; I have hesitated, but will do so no longer. Great
things are expected from me, and I must not disappoint
those who have placed their hopes upon me. Marie must
not be allowed to keep me bound down in the gutter. It
is not my place. I was destined to walk on higher heights;
and since it is impossible for me to raise her, she must be
cut adrift. It may seem cowardly; it may be cruel for
me to do this; but it must be done, for I cannot endure
the double life any longer. Is a man to suffer all his life
for one false step? Am I justified in breaking the hearts
of parents and betrothed? No. It must not be—shall
not be. In a few weeks I shall send in my resignation,
and quit Paris for ever. It will cause a nine days’ wonder,
but what of that? People will say I am a fool, but it
won’t affect me. I shall plead that I know my own affairs
best, and that circumstances of a private and pressing
nature necessitate my hasty return to Russia. This I am
determined to do, cost what it may. I have taken Eugène
Peon into my confidence. He will help me, and satisfy
the curious when I am gone.’</p>



<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>There was a significance in the foregoing passages which
was not lost upon Danevitch. The Count gave himself
away, though, of course, he never expected that any eyes
but his own would read what he had written. It will be said,
of course, that it was foolish for him to have committed
his thoughts to paper; though it must be remembered
that there are some men who seem to derive a strange
pleasure in recording their evil deeds. It is a well-known
fact that some of the greatest criminals have kept diaries,
in which they have written the most damning evidence of
their guilt. The Count’s diary proved conclusively that
there were certain ugly passages in his life, and two points
were made clear—there was a woman in the case, and
Eugène Peon knew more of the Count’s affairs than he
cared to own to, and confirmed Danevitch in his belief
that Peon was a crafty man, and by no means carried his
heart upon his sleeve.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the Count’s father was much cut
up, as he realized that his son had been guilty of evil which
was calculated to reflect upon the honour of the family,
that honour of which the old man was so proud, and which
he would gladly have died to shield.</p>

<p>Of course it became necessary now to find out who the
‘Marie’ referred to in the diary was; for it was obvious
that she was directly or indirectly responsible for the
Count’s disappearance. No letters could be discovered
which were calculated to throw any light on the subject,
but in a small drawer of the Count’s desk there was found
the photograph of a young woman, and on the back, in a
scrawling hand, was the following:</p>

<p class="center">‘For ever and ever thine.<br />

<span class="gap"><span class="smcap">Marie.</span>’</span></p>

<p>The likeness was that of a singularly handsome girl of
about two-and-twenty; but the handwriting was so bad
it suggested that the writer was not educated.</p>

<p>Danevitch felt now that he was in possession of a clue—a
vague one, it was true, but it was possible it might lead
to very important results. Marie must be found, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
he did not know at the moment how he was going to find
her. Paris was a big place; Marie was a very common
name. Danevitch, however, having once got on the scent,
was not likely to go very far astray, and he generally
found some means of bringing down his quarry at last.
He was not indifferent to the self-evident fact that in this
case there were no ordinary difficulties to contend against;
this was proved by the large reward having failed to bring
forth any information. It showed that those who were
responsible for the Count’s disappearance had very powerful
motives for keeping their secret; and whether few or
many were interested in that secret, ten thousand francs
was not strong enough to tempt one of them; and it
seemed as if it was not the Count’s money that was
responsible for his disappearance. He kept a banking
account in Paris, but this had not been drawn upon since
the week before he went away, when he cashed a cheque
for three thousand francs. But at this stage a curious
incident was brought to light, which put a new complexion
on the matter altogether.</p>

<p>The incident was this: It appeared that the Count also
kept a considerable account at the Moscow branch of the
Bank of Russia. He owned a good deal of property in
and about Moscow, part of it being a flourishing flax-mill,
which turned over a princely revenue. His Moscow
affairs were managed by an agent who had been connected
with the family for nearly half a century. It was his duty
to pay all money that he received into the bank without
delay. Consequently, there was generally a large balance
standing to the Count’s credit. One day a three months’
bill of exchange, purporting to be drawn on the Count by
Paul Pavlovitch and Co., flax merchants, at Riga, for one
hundred thousand francs, and accepted by the Count and
payable at the bank in Moscow, was duly presented by an
individual, who stated that he was a member of the firm.
As all seemed right, the bill was paid, and a receipt given
in the name of Peter Pavlovitch, who represented himself
as the son of Paul. A week later the cancelled bill passed
into the hands of the Count’s agent, and he at once declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
it to be a forgery. Pavlovitch and Co., of Riga,
were immediately communicated with, and they denied all
knowledge of the Count, had never had any business transactions
with him, had never drawn a bill upon him, and
knew nothing of Peter Pavlovitch. This was a revelation
indeed, and pointed conclusively to a conspiracy. It
seemed to Danevitch pretty evident that the person who
forged the bill knew a good deal about the Count, and if
that person could be laid hold of the plot might be unmasked.
There was another thing, too, that appeared to
be no less clear: the forger of the bill was acquainted with
the Count’s affairs, and also with Russia. The firm of
Paul Pavlovitch and Co., of Riga, was an old-established
firm, and there was nothing to strike a stranger as peculiar
in their holding a bill of the Count’s; for the Count was the
owner of a flax-mill, and did business with a good many flax
merchants. Nevertheless, the bank in Moscow was blamed
for having been somewhat lax in paying the bill without
having taken steps to satisfy themselves that the person
who presented it was the person he represented himself to
be. Moreover, in the business world bills of that nature
were usually collected by a bank. However, the Moscow
bank people defended themselves by saying that, though
a little out of course, there was nothing extraordinary in
a bill being presented by a member of a firm holding it.</p>

<p>As soon as Danevitch heard of the incident of the
forged bill, he returned at once to Moscow, deeming it
probable that he might there pick up some thread which
would lead him to a clue. The man calling himself Peter
Pavlovitch, to whom the money was paid, was described as
of medium height, of muscular build, dark-complexioned,
black hair, beard, and moustache, in age about thirty.
He was well dressed, and the receipt he gave was written
in a bold, clerkly hand. Of course, there was nothing in
this description to distinguish him from thousands of
others, and Moscow was a large place; but Danevitch went
to work on the assumption that the man, whoever he
might be, was well acquainted with the Count, and he
knew a good deal of his business; that, to some extent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
narrowed the inquiry, which was necessarily directed to
trying to discover a person upon whom suspicion could
justifiably fasten.</p>

<p>The Count’s agent was a Pole named Padrewski. He
was a man of high repute, and one in whom his employer
placed the greatest confidence. He could not even vaguely
identify the self-styled ‘Peter Pavlovitch’ from the description
given, and was of opinion that he was not a resident
in Moscow, though probably not a stranger. If he
was not a resident in the city, it was likely enough that
he sojourned there long enough to enable him to transact
his business, and having possessed himself of the money, he
would depart without delay. Danevitch ascertained that
the bill was presented for payment about half-past ten in
the morning. That argued that the person who drew the
money and gave the receipt had slept in the city, and
probably lodged at some café or hotel. So the detective
set to work at once to make inquiries at the various hotels
and lodging-houses. In Russia, as in France and Germany,
every lodging-house-keeper and hotel proprietor is compelled
by law to keep a register of his guests. It is therefore
far easier to discover anyone who occupies temporary
lodgings than it is in this country. Now, it struck Danevitch
that, if the presenter of the forged bill had come to
Moscow for the sole purpose of drawing the money, he
would in all probability select a place near the railway-station.
There were several hotels and cafés in the
vicinity of the station. At all of these inquiries were
made, and, at a third-rate café-restaurant, called in
Russian The Traveller’s Joy, it was found that a man
answering the description of the one required had stayed
in the house for four days, and had taken his departure by
train on the same day that the bill was presented; and on
that very day he had paid his account with a brand-new
five hundred rouble note, receiving the change in small
money. As the restaurant-keeper could not cash the note
himself, he got it done at a money-changer’s in the neighbourhood.
The money-changer made an entry of the
number of the note, and by that Danevitch was able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
prove that it was one of the notes paid by the bank to
‘Peter Pavlovitch.’ This, of course, was an important
discovery, as it conclusively proved that the man who
handed the note to the landlord was the one who got the
money for the forged bill. This was an important link,
and another was soon discovered.</p>

<p>‘From information received,’ to quote the common
police-court expression, Danevitch learnt that during the
time the pseudo Peter Pavlovitch was staying at The
Traveller’s Joy he was visited daily by a pretty young
woman, who, from her manner, style of dress, and general
get-up, was supposed to be connected with the theatrical
profession. Every evening Peter went out with her, then
both returned together and supped, and after that went
out again, and some time later Peter returned alone. The
deduction from this was, assuming she belonged to the
theatrical profession, that Peter took her to the theatre at
night, brought her back to supper after she had done her
work, and then saw her home to her lodgings. Fortunately,
a very minute description of the woman was forthcoming,
and from this Danevitch ultimately identified her
as a Fräulein Holzstein, supposed to be of Austrian or
German nationality. She was a music-hall singer, and had
been fulfilling an engagement at a hall in Moscow, but had
then left and gone to a place of entertainment in St.
Petersburg, whither Danevitch journeyed without delay.
He soon discovered the lady he was seeking, but was very
cautious not to let her know that she was under surveillance.
He had no difficulty in making her acquaintance,
in the capacity of a man about town who enjoyed
the privilege of being allowed on the stage; and on one
or two occasions she deigned to accept an invitation to sup
with him. He learnt from her that when her engagement
terminated in St. Petersburg, as it would do in a few days,
she was going to Vienna for a week, thence to Berlin for a
fortnight, and after that to Paris to perform in a sensational
drama at the Châtelet. Danevitch was now instinctively
certain that he was on the trail, and he
resolved not to lose it. Therefore, when Fräulein Holzstein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
took her departure from the Russian capital, he left by the
same train, though she was not aware of it. He followed
her to Vienna, from Vienna to Berlin, from Berlin to Paris.
When she arrived at Paris she was met by a man who was
at once identified from the description Danevitch had
received as the man who had presented the forged bill for
payment at the Moscow bank. The scent was now getting
warm, but at this stage it would have been premature to
have taken any steps calculated to frighten the quarry
which was being so patiently shadowed. This man and
woman were not the only actors in the drama, if, as was
thought probable, they were in any way connected with
the Count’s disappearance; and Danevitch had yet to
prove that there was any connection between that incident
and the forged bill.</p>

<p>The man who had passed himself off as Peter Pavlovitch
in Moscow was known in Paris as Henri Charcot, and by
calling he was a theatrical and music-hall agent. He rented
a small office not very far from the Châtelet Theatre; but,
judging from appearances, he was not in a very flourishing
way of business, although Danevitch gathered that at one
time he had had an extensive connection. He had lost
it, however, by inattention and shady practices. Fräulein
Holzstein was, or at any rate represented herself to be,
the wife of Charcot.</p>

<p>Another discovery was now made by the patient and
watchful Danevitch. A man was in the habit of visiting
the Charcots. He occupied a much higher social position
than they did; but it was made evident he did not care
for his visits being known to other people, for he always
went at night, and invariably wore a cloak of such ample
proportions that his figure was practically disguised, while
a broad-brimmed, soft hat served to conceal his features.
The Charcots lived in rather a poor quarter of Paris, not
far from the Gare de l’Est. In this region was a very
popular and much-frequented restaurant, largely patronized
by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. The Charcots
invariably went there to dine. And when the strange man
visited them, he generally went with them to dine or sup,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
as the case might be, on those occasions. They indulged
in the privacy of a <i>cabinet particulière</i>, as it is called in
France—that is to say, a private room.</p>

<p>One night the three went to the restaurant for dinner,
and were shown into a snug cabinet, where a small stove
dispensed a comforting warmth, for the night was excessively
cold, and to protect the occupants from draught
a heavy screen was drawn between the table and the window.
When the coffee and cognac were placed on the table,
and Madame Charcot and the two men had lighted their
cigarettes, the waiter was dismissed and the door closed.
Then the lady and her two companions, feeling under no
restraint, freely indulged in conversation.</p>

<p>‘Do you people intend to remain in Paris?’ asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think so,’ replied Charcot. ‘I don’t see that
there is much to fear. No one suspects us, and it is not
worth while giving up our business, such as it is.’</p>

<p>‘You feel sure that your visit to Russia in connection
with the bill is not known?’</p>

<p>‘Perfectly sure. My wife and I managed the business
too cleverly for suspicion to be directed against us.’</p>

<p>‘But you mustn’t forget that Michael Danevitch has got
the matter in hand.’</p>

<p>Madame Charcot broke into a mocking laugh, as she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘Pooh! There is nothing to fear from Danevitch. He
is a very much overrated man. All the wonderful stories
that one hears about him are, I believe, invented by himself;
any way, I am not afraid of him. It seems to me
that it was impossible for anyone to get a clue in Russia.
No, mon frère; the business has been managed too cleverly,
and unless we give ourselves away we are perfectly safe.’</p>

<p>‘I am not so sure of that,’ answered the stranger
musingly.</p>

<p>‘But you’ve not heard or seen anything to cause you
alarm, have you?’ asked Charcot.</p>

<p>‘No, no, not at all,’ said the stranger, pulling his moustache
and looking grave; ‘but one never knows.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>‘You are surely in a despondent mood, cher frère.
The dinner must have disagreed with you,’ madame remarked
banteringly.</p>

<p>‘The dinner was all right; but I haven’t been easy in
my mind for some time.’</p>

<p>‘It’s the liver, the liver, my dear boy,’ Charcot remarked.</p>

<p>‘What’s the use of troubling yourself about shadows?’
put in the lady. ‘Haven’t the Paris police used some of
their best men, and yet failed to get a scent?’</p>

<p>‘That’s true,’ said the stranger; ‘but the affair must
come to light sooner or later.’</p>

<p>‘And what if it does?’ asked madame. ‘How are we
to be identified with the case?’</p>

<p>‘Not easily, if he is dead,’ answered the stranger. ‘The
dead tell no tales.’</p>

<p>‘Then, why in the name of common-sense should he
live?’ asked Madame Charcot, blowing a stream of smoke
from her nostrils, and speaking with energy.</p>

<p>The stranger shuddered, and said:</p>

<p>‘I’ll have nothing whatever to do with his death.’</p>

<p>‘You are chicken-hearted, man,’ Charcot remarked.
‘One word and an extra hundred francs to old Pierre, and
every danger would be removed.’</p>

<p>‘It might, or might not. Any way, I would rather not
speak the word. The business has been bungled as it is,
and instead of its proving a source of wealth to us, we
only made a miserable hundred thousand francs between
us, and it’s hopeless to expect that we can get any more.’</p>

<p>‘You should have played your cards better,’ remarked
Charcot.</p>

<p>‘But who in the name of Satan thought that he was
going to peg out as he has done.’</p>

<p>‘Well, there is one thing we mustn’t forget,’ said
madame; ‘unless Pierre’s palms are kept well greased, he’ll
let the cat out of the bag.’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t think he will do that. He has already
been well paid; and before I gave him the last thousand
francs I made the old rascal sign a document, in which he
confesses his share in the business, so that if he turns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
traitor I’ve got him on the hip. But, any way, it strikes
me this is not a safe place, and I shall go abroad. No
living soul suspects me, but one never knows what may
happen; it’s best to be on the safe side.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you are a soldier of fortune,’ said Charcot, ‘and
can march at an hour’s notice; but we’ve got interests here,
and unless danger really menaces, it would be folly for us
to sacrifice those interests. What do you say?’ turning to
his wife.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I think it’s all right. If we have reason to believe
there is any danger, we can clear out; but my own impression
is that there is not much chance of our being
suspected. Besides, we must have more money yet. Fate
has been against us in that respect. We bungled in the
beginning, and are paying the penalty of the error. By-and-by,
however, we may be rewarded.’</p>

<p>‘If you think so, you are much more of an optimist than
I am,’ the stranger remarked.</p>

<p>‘You’ve always been disposed to look on the gloomy side
of things,’ said madame sharply. ‘What is the use of
meeting trouble half-way? We’ve played our cards, and
must abide by the game. At any rate, you’ve done fairly
well, and fortune has favoured you throughout your life.
You’ve no just cause to grumble.’</p>

<p>‘But suppose the game goes against us?’ now asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>‘What is the use of supposing? It hasn’t done so up
to the present, and we’ve netted a fair stake.’</p>

<p>‘But nothing nearly as much as we ought to have
done.’</p>

<p>‘That can’t be helped. We’ve not lost, any way. But,
for goodness’ sake, don’t mope like that. You make me
miserable. We’ve bled our victim pretty freely, and though
he has plenty more blood in him, if we cannot get it, we
had better be satisfied.’</p>

<p>‘It’s tantalizing, nevertheless. Don’t you think we
might risk another bill here?’</p>

<p>‘No; it would be too dangerous,’ said madame.</p>

<p>‘I would have nothing to do with it,’ added her husband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
‘Any attempt of that kind would betray us as sure as fate.
No, no, mon cher; it can’t be done.’</p>

<p>The stranger sighed, and resigned himself to the situation,
for he was forced to admit that the arguments used
against him were unanswerable.</p>

<p>In a little while the party broke up. The stranger
embraced the woman warmly, and, shaking hands with the
man, hurried away.</p>

<p>Charcot and his wife lingered for a while to smoke
another cigarette, and for the man to consume an absinthe.</p>

<p>‘Eugène is melancholy,’ the woman remarked; ‘but it’s
folly to weep over the milk that is lost. If matters hadn’t
turned out as they have done, we might all have raked in
a snug little fortune. But, as it is, we haven’t done so
badly, and we’re safe.’</p>

<p>‘But not as safe as we should be if the Count were
dead,’ the husband remarked.</p>

<p>‘That’s true,’ said the woman thoughtfully, while her
pretty face took on a very wicked expression. ‘But you
know Eugène is far too sentimental. It doesn’t do to be
sentimental in a case of this kind. We’ve got ourselves to
consider, and, having gone so far, it is downright folly to
hesitate to take the final step, which would complete the
work. What do you think?’</p>

<p>‘I agree with you.’</p>

<p>‘Then, you go and see Pierre, and give him a quiet hint.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve a good mind to,’ mused the husband.</p>

<p>‘Don’t spoil a good mind, dear.’</p>

<p>‘But, you know, we should have to give the old rascal
two or three hundred francs more.’</p>

<p>‘And it’s worth it; we can afford it. Better to pay
that than allow a risk to remain that we can remove.’</p>

<p>‘You are right—you are right, dear,’ said the husband.</p>

<p>‘And you will go and see Pierre?’</p>

<p>‘I must consider the matter.’</p>

<p>‘Tut, man! What does it want consideration for? We
are agreed on the subject. Vacillation shows weakness.
Hesitation may cost us dear. Make up your mind at
once.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>‘It’s made up,’ said the husband, after some reflection.</p>

<p>‘And you will go?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘When?’</p>

<p>‘To-morrow morning.’</p>

<p>‘Good. That’s a point settled, and my mind is easier.’</p>

<p>The man and woman now took their departure; but
little did they dream that every word of the conversation
which they and the stranger—who was none other than
Eugène Peon—had uttered had been most carefully taken
down in shorthand. Behind the screen a young man had
patiently sat the whole evening, with note-book and pencil
in hand. He was a trusted agent of Danevitch, who had
made arrangements with the landlord of the restaurant.
And thus the conspirators had been neatly trapped.
Nevertheless, the story was not all learnt yet, and Danevitch
considered it would have been premature to make
any move or show his hand until he found out where the
Count was concealed. Of course, a close watch was set on
Eugène Peon’s movements, so that no chance should be
afforded him of slipping through the meshes of the net
which was so cleverly being drawn around him and his
companions in guilt. Charcot was also closely shadowed,
and the next day was followed to an old house situated in
the western part of Paris, outside of the barrier. It was a
curious, ramshackle, tumble-down-looking building, mournful
and melancholy in its ruin, and mournful and melancholy
in its surroundings. At one time it had probably
been the country residence of some rich person, standing
in pleasant gardens, on the banks of a stream, and commanding
a fine panoramic view. But that was in the long
ago. The grounds were now a howling wilderness; the
stream was a foul and stagnant strip of slimy water, from
which protruded the decaying ribs of a half-sunk barge.</p>

<p>Within twenty or thirty yards were the grim and
blackened ruins of a burnt-out mill that at one period had
been a flourishing concern. The stream communicated
with a canal a quarter of a mile away, and time was when
barges came and went. The house had been the private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
residence of the owner of the mill, and he lived there for
many years in contentment and comfort with his wife and
son and daughter. Then misfortune overtook him. His
daughter was accidentally drowned in the stream. Some
time afterwards the son died of consumption. Then the
unfortunate father gave way to dissipation, and neglected
his business, with the usual result. At length the mill was
destroyed by fire, and when the owner went to the insurance
offices to claim the amount for which he had
insured, the people refused to pay it, alleging that the fire
was due to incendiarism, and a charge was laid against the
unfortunate man; but he rendered it useless by drowning
himself in the stream. And his widow did not long survive
him; grief killed her. Then litigation ensued about the
property, and as a legal heir could not be found, it fell into
ruin and neglect. For many years a man named Pierre
Mousson had been allowed to occupy the place, subject to
the payment of a nominal rental. He was a rag-picker
by calling, and a reputed miser: a low-browed, villainous-looking
rascal, who had once served a term of imprisonment
for nearly beating a companion to death during a quarrel
about a franc, which he accused his companion of stealing
from him. With that exception, there had been no charge
against him. He was a big, muscular old fellow, with a
suggestiveness in his appearance that he could be very
dangerous in defence of himself or his belongings. His
mother lived with him. She was an old woman, upwards
of eighty years of age, and half imbecile.</p>

<p>To this place Charcot was followed by Danevitch and
three French police officers, all heavily armed; and while
Charcot and old Pierre were conferring together, the
Russian and his companions entered, to the utter amazement
of the two rascals, who were made prisoners before
they could recover from their surprise. To both of them
this <i>coup</i> must have been like a thunderbolt, but perhaps
more particularly so to Charcot, who only the night before
seemed to think he was in little or no danger. In a cellar
or vault, below the level of the putrid stream, a man was
discovered in a state of idiocy. He was lying on a low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
truckle bed, close to the damp, slimy wall, to which he was
fastened by a chain and staple, and a broad leather belt
round his waist. The vault was fœtid, and inconceivably
horrible with filth and noisomeness, and the wretched man’s
feet and hands had been partly gnawed by rats. That
man was Count Dashkoff, the once brilliant and handsome
attaché, but now a pitiable and unrecognisable wreck. His
hair was matted with slime and dirt, his beard unkempt,
his eyes sunken, his face awful in its corpse-like appearance.
His body was so emaciated that he was simply an animated
skeleton, while the few rags that clung to his vermin-covered
body scarcely sufficed to hide his nakedness.</p>

<p>As soon as possible, the poor fellow was removed in an
ambulance to a hospital, the imbecile old woman was
conveyed to an asylum, while Charcot and Pierre were
hurried to prison. An hour later Eugène Peon and
Madame Charcot were arrested, and before the day was
out—thanks to certain letters found in Madame Charcot’s
possession—another man was being searched for. His
name was Buhler, and he had recently acted as secretary
to the Count, replacing a young man who had died.
Buhler was a Russian, but had long resided in Paris. He
was recommended to the Count by Eugène Peon. As
was subsequently proved, Buhler had once before fulfilled
the position of a secretary, but been dismissed for dishonesty.
Since then he had got his living as a waiter,
until he became a creature of Peon’s. The strangest part
of the tale has now to be told.</p>

<p>As most people know, the mode of procedure in France
in connection with criminal cases is very different to that
adopted in England. In a certain sense it partakes somewhat
of the nature of the Inquisition. A functionary, who
is known as a Judge of Instruction (<i>Juge d’Instruction</i>),
with his assistants and clerks, subjects a suspected person
to an ordeal of examination which few can pass through
unscathed, unless they be absolutely innocent. The Judge
is a legal man of wide experience, and generally with a very
intimate knowledge of human nature. He is an adept in
the art of cross-examination, and the ‘suspect’ must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
clever indeed if he can outwit this examining Judge. Where
several persons are under suspicion of complicity, they are
confronted with each other, and very rarely do they fail to
condemn themselves, and betray their guilt, if they are
guilty, under the pitiless fire of questioning to which they
are subjected. In this way the truth is brought to light,
and piece by piece a story is built up. The story that
was partly wrung from the prisoners in this case, and
partly learnt from other sources, was as follows:</p>

<p>Years before the events already narrated, an Austrian
named Schumacher took up his residence in Paris, with
his wife and two daughters, named respectively Rosine and
Anna, and a son, Fritz. The girls were at that time quite
children. Schumacher, who was a cabinet-maker by trade,
and his family ultimately became naturalized French
subjects. As the girls grew up, they developed remarkable
beauty; but this was allied to vulgar tastes and loose
habits, well calculated to bring them to trouble sooner
or later. At quite an early age they showed talent for
the stage, and began life at a café-chantant. In the
course of time Anna married a theatrical and music-hall
agent named Charcot; and Rosine, who seems to have had
numerous lovers, joined a theatrical company, and travelled
for some time, but ultimately secured a permanent engagement
at a Paris theatre. Soon after that, when she was
only one-and-twenty years of age, and noted for her good
looks, she made the acquaintance of Count Dashkoff. The
Count was young, impressionable, foolish; the girl artful,
cunning, clever. And there is no doubt she resolved to
play her cards with a view to gaining a powerful influence
over the Count. In this matter she was aided and abetted
by her brother Fritz, though that gentleman was no longer
known as Fritz.</p>

<p>At quite an early age Fritz had come under the notice
of an old and rather eccentric lady, who sent him to school,
fostered in him expensive tastes, luxurious habits, and led
him to dream of future greatness. He received a good
education, and spent four years—from sixteen to twenty—at
the Lyceum. Unfortunately for him, his patroness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
died. It was then found that, though she had made a
will leaving a million and a half francs to the young
man, she was not worth a million sous. She had simply
enjoyed a life interest in a property which produced her a
handsome income, though she expended it to the last sou
every year. Fritz had also taken her name of Peon, and
had substituted Eugène for that of Fritz.</p>

<p>To find himself penniless was a great blow to his hopes
and pride. His natural talents and the education he had
received should have enabled him to have done well, but
he hated work; he lacked energy, and so he set himself
to live by his wits. He was a fascinating young fellow,
with the power of attracting both men and women. When
he made the acquaintance of the Count, the Count at once
took to him, and Peon was far too clever to lose such an
opportunity of benefiting himself; for clever as the Count
was, he was rash and weak-minded in many respects, and
no match for an unscrupulous adventurer like Peon, who
arranged with his sister Rosine that they were to keep
their relationship secret, and use every endeavour to trap
the Count into a marriage. Rosine was quite equal to
playing her part in this nefarious little scheme. Her
fascinations proved too much for the Count, and when he
found that she was deaf to all his entreaties, and proof
against his costly presents, he came to the conclusion that
she was a model woman, a paragon of virtue, a credit to
her sex, and in an evil hour he married her. After that
it did not take him long to discover what a terrible error
he had made. The wife’s rapacity for money, jewellery,
dress, was insatiable, and her brother Eugène took good
care to share her purse.</p>

<p>For a considerable time the Count yielded to the bleeding
process tamely; and his secretary, Buhler, working in
connection with Peon and Rosine, succeeded in drawing
from him large sums of money. Of course, all this time
the unhappy Count believed that his friend Eugène Peon
was true and reliable, that Buhler was the most faithful
of secretaries, and he began to yearn for some means of
breaking the matrimonial bond with which he had bound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
himself. He found that Rosine had developed a taste for
drink; he encouraged this in every possible way, and
induced her particularly to consume large quantities of
absinthe. The result was, she soon became a confirmed
dipsomaniac; and one night, to the horror of the band of
conspirators, she either threw herself into the Seine or
fell in accidentally; at any rate, she was drowned. That
was at a little village about twenty miles from Paris, where
the Count had installed her, and where, under an arrangement
with him, she lived as a single woman.</p>

<p>Peon, Buhler, and Anna Charcot and her husband
managed to keep the news of his wife’s death from the
Count, and he was given to understand that she had taken
herself off somewhere. A few months passed, and the
conspirators felt the loss of their supplies severely. Then,
in their desperation, they concocted a scheme which, for
daring and wickedness, had not been surpassed for a long
time. The scheme was nothing more nor less than the
abduction of the Count, who was to be kept a prisoner
until he secured his release by the payment of a large
ransom.</p>

<p>The night of the ball was chosen as a fitting opportunity
to put the plan into execution. Buhler wrote a
letter closely imitating Rosine’s handwriting. The letter
stated that she had been away from Paris, but had come
back seriously ill, and was then unable to leave her bed.
She craved him to go and see her immediately, and
promised that, if he would give her a sum of money down,
she would go away and he should never hear of her again.
If not, she would proclaim the following morning to all
Paris that she was his lawful wife, and would also send an
intimation to that effect to the Embassy. The note
wound up by saying that a carriage would be in waiting
not far from his house to convey him to her lodgings, and
that he could easily get back again in an hour or an hour
and a half.</p>

<p>This letter was delivered to the Count in the way that
we have seen, and, unhappily for himself, he was influenced
by it. He found the carriage at the spot indicated, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
was driven out to the barrier to Pierre’s house. Two
powerful ruffians, who were to be well paid for their part
of the work, had ridden on the box beside the coachman.
When the destination was reached, the Count alighted,
and then the lonely spot seems to have caused him to
suspect that he had been brought there for some villainous
purpose. He at once stepped into the carriage again, and
ordered the coachman to drive him back to Paris. The
two ruffians, however, seized him and dragged him out on
to the road, where a desperate struggle took place. To
put an end to it, one of the rascals struck the unhappy
Count a violent blow over the head with a heavy stick,
rendering him unconscious. He was then carried into
Pierre’s den.</p>

<p>For two days he remained insensible, and when he
recovered it was found, to the horror of all the wretches
concerned, that he was imbecile, but it was hoped that he
would be all right in a few days. These hopes, however, were
doomed to disappointment, and, being pressed for money,
Buhler undertook to forge a bill, and Madame Charcot,
who was then fulfilling an engagement in Moscow, was
instructed to find out something of the Count’s business
transactions there; while Charcot went to Moscow, and,
representing himself as Peter Pavlovitch, presented the
forged bill at the bank and received payment for it. The
money was, of course, shared by all concerned. Buhler,
who seems to have been shrewder than the rest of them,
having got his share, and possessed himself of such portable
property of the Count’s as he could lay his hands upon,
took himself off somewhere, and managed to elude justice,
though every effort was made to capture him.</p>

<p>As already stated, all this terrible story of fiendish
wickedness was gradually brought to light by the Juge
d’Instruction, and there was little doubt that, had Danevitch
not succeeded in unravelling the plot, the unfortunate
Count, who was becoming an expensive burden, and a
menace to the safety of the plotters, would have been
placed in a sack with a quantity of scrap iron, and deposited
at the bottom of the foul and stagnant water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
opposite Pierre’s hovel. Peon showed considerable reluctance
to resort to this extreme measure, but Madame Charcot,
who was less sentimental and more callous, had no scruples.
She saw clearly enough that as long as the poor Count
remained alive there was an ever-present danger, for if
Pierre should get into trouble or die a revelation was
certain. She influenced her husband to take her view of
the case, and had Danevitch not stepped in when he did,
murder would have been added to the other infamy. As
it was, the careers of the wretches were brought to a close,
and exemplary punishment was meted out to all of them.
The extradition of both Charcot and his wife was demanded
by the Russian Government, to answer in Russia
for the affair of the forged bill—the man for having presented
it and drawn the money, the woman for aiding and
abetting him. But, of course, this demand was not complied
with, as they had first of all to suffer punishment in
France for their deeds there. After that they would be
handed to the tender mercies of the Russian Government,
and were destined to end their days in exile in Siberia.</p>

<p>For a long time Count Dashkoff remained in a pitiable
state, but under tender care and treatment his health was
gradually restored, though his mind was shattered beyond
repair. Of course, he could not be altogether exonerated
from blame for the part he had played with regard to his
unhappy wife. But if he had sinned, he had also suffered,
and everyone must admit that it was a terrible ending to a
brilliant and what seemed a most promising career. Unhappily,
neither his position, his wealth, nor his associations
could save him from yielding to the fatal fascinations
of vulgar beauty; and the disastrous results that followed
doomed him to social extinction and a living death.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE FATE OF VASSILO IVANOFF.</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Possibly</span> very few readers of these chronicles know anything
of the peculiarity—I had almost said iniquity—of
the Russian law. The freeborn Briton, who in his own
country may spout and write treason as long as it pleases
him, and do anything that is not regarded as a legally
punishable offence—and the law is very tolerant in this
respect—is apt to open his eyes in astonishment when he
goes on the Continent and finds himself haled to a prison-house
simply because he has been jotting down some
memoranda in a note-book, or mayhap has taken a snap-shot
with a Kodak at a picturesque fortification which he
thinks will look well in his album when he gets home.
This arbitrary and high-handed proceeding is common to
all parts of Europe outside of Great Britain. But though
the liberty of the subject and of the foreigner is ever
menaced on the Continent, and a simple indiscreet act may
serve to bring the might of the law down on the luckless
offender, this state of things is nothing as compared with
that which prevails in Russia. It is a plain statement of
fact to say that, of all the countries which boast of their
civilization, Russia is the least civilized. The Russians
themselves are a most hospitable people, they are clever,
they make good friends and good neighbours; but their
laws are antiquated, the method of government is barbarous,
while the system of espionage which is in force all
over the country would irritate a Briton into madness.
And there is another aspect of the law, which, though it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
has been denied, still obtains in Russia, and that is the
power of the law to keep an untried man whose guilt is
not proved in prison indefinitely, and to subject him to
such mental or physical torture that, to escape from it, the
victim either confesses to a crime of which he is innocent
or goes raving mad. To understand this, one must bear
in mind that, while in our country a man is considered
innocent until he is proved guilty, in Russia, as soon as
ever he falls under suspicion, he is regarded as a criminal.
He can then be thrown into a dungeon and kept there.
If he persists in asserting his innocence, the law, if it can
procure no proof one way or the other, will persist in regarding
him as guilty, and will exhaust every means to
overcome him, and if compelled to let him go will do so
with the greatest reluctance.</p>

<p>This is really no exaggerated statement. A thousand
and one proofs can be furnished in support of it. Danevitch,
who was Russian to the backbone, was nevertheless
sufficiently broad-minded to frankly admit that the laws of
his native country left much to be desired. The case dealt
with in this story will illustrate very forcibly what I have
stated in the foregoing lines.</p>

<p>Vassilo Ivanoff was by profession an architect, with, as
was supposed, a large and profitable connection. He was
also an artist of some repute, and two or three of his
pictures had found a place on the walls of the St. Petersburg
Salon. His friends sometimes rated him for devoting
too much time to painting pictures that did not pay, and
too little to his profession, which did pay. Ivanoff, however,
was young, ardent, enthusiastic; a dreamer somewhat.
He believed in himself, in his future. The world was
beautiful, life was good, all men were brothers. Such in
effect were his principles; but he forgot the maxim of
science, which insists that theory and practice should go
together. Ivanoff was a theorist, but he found it difficult
to be practical. He had long been engaged to Maria
Alexeyevina, who had the reputation of being one of the
most beautiful young women in St. Petersburg. She was
a member of an exceedingly good family, who, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
poor, boasted of their noble descent. The marriage of
the young couple had been delayed from time to time on
the grounds that, until his financial position improved, he
could not afford to keep a wife. It was a great disappointment
to him, but he set to work with a will, and so
far increased his business that he felt justified at last in
appealing to Maria and her relatives that the marriage
should be no longer delayed.</p>

<p>Among Ivanoff’s most intimate friends was one Riskoff
by name, who was said to be wealthy, and also exceedingly
practical. He and Ivanoff had been to school together,
and had studied at college together; but Riskoff, being
considerably older than his friend, completed his studies
some years before the other.</p>

<p>Ivanoff was in the habit of consulting Riskoff about
many things, and he took him into his confidence with
regard to the marriage; but Riskoff, knowing that Ivan
was improvident, as well as impractical, strongly counselled
him to delay the marriage. Ivanoff, however, was head-strong,
Riskoff was persistent, with the result that the
lifelong friends virtually quarrelled, and in the circles
which they frequented it was a matter of comment that
these two men, who had been like brothers, now passed
each other by as if they were strangers.</p>

<p>Unable at last to control his feelings, Ivanoff pleaded so
pathetically to Maria to consent to the marriage that she
yielded, and they became man and wife. The marriage
ceremony was one of those semi-grand affairs peculiar to
the middle classes in Russia, and the festivities that
followed were conspicuous by their magnificence and the
lavish expenditure incurred. It was noted with much surprise
at the time that Riskoff was not present at the
wedding or the feast. It was known that there had been
strained relations between the two men; nevertheless,
everyone expected that Riskoff would have been invited.
But, in spite of his friend’s absence, Ivanoff was supremely
happy; the beautiful woman for whom he would have
laid down his life willingly, had she desired it, was his at
last. What more could mortal man wish for? Life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
henceforth would know no pang. The doting couple
would exist on each other’s love, and not the tiniest of
clouds should ever obscure the matrimonial sky. It was
all very pretty. Others had thought the same thing over
and over again, only to find, when the first transports
of joy were past, that the married state is not quite the
Elysium they believed it to be when they hastened to exchange
single blessedness for wedded bliss. The blessedness
is at least a known quantity, but the bliss is as
often as not found to be little better than a delusive
mirage. Ivanoff, however, did not concern himself about
the future. With him, sufficient for the day was the evil
thereof. Why think of the morrow when the to-day was
so full of joy? That was his theory, and he lived up to it.</p>

<p>The first year of his married life, so far as was known,
was a very happy one; the young couple revelled in each
other’s society. Their social functions were attended by
people from far and near, for Maria’s beauty was the talk
of the town, and her husband was very happy and very
proud. He believed that no such woman as his wife had
ever walked the fair earth before. Romance, however,
cannot last for ever, and joy must ever be evanescent in
this wicked world. Vassilo Ivanoff was soon to prove
the truth of this. Necessity compelled him at last to look
into his affairs, and he found to his horror that he was on
the verge of bankruptcy. Bills were pouring in upon him,
but there was nothing in the exchequer to meet them with.
It was a terrible state of matters, and to a sensitive man
with a poetical temperament little short of maddening.
From his ideal world he had suddenly to descend to the
vulgar commonplace one, where the butcher, the baker, and
candlestick-maker clamour for their little accounts; where
summonses and writs run; and where brokers’ men and
sheriffs’ officers have no bowels of compunction. It was a
revelation, and a very terrible one, to Vassilo, and he had
to face the fact that he was heavily in debt, with no means
to meet his engagements. He could not apply to his wife’s
relations for assistance, for they were poor and proud, and,
while unable to help him, they would not have hesitated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
rate him for the disgrace he would bring upon them if his
affairs should be made public, and there was every probability
that such would be the case.</p>

<p>It was subsequently brought to light that in his distress
he applied to various friends for temporary assistance; but,
because they either could not or would not render it, his
appeals met with no response. There is no doubt that his
affairs at this stage of his career were in a very complicated
state, and he realized for the first time that he was practically
ruined; and to such an extent did it affect him, that
one night he was seen at one of the fashionable and best-known
cafés in a state of intoxication. Probably a good
deal was due to his mental excitement rather than to the
amount of stimulant he had imbibed, for he was a most
temperate man, and rarely went to excess. Some acquaintances
tried to persuade him to go home, but his
excitement only increased, and he was heard to exclaim:
‘It’s a burning shame that I should be poor when there
are thousands less worthy than I am rolling in wealth. I
feel as if I could do murder on those who hoard their gold
when so many are suffering for the want of common necessaries.’</p>

<p>This little outburst of passion and ill-will was no doubt
due entirely to his condition; but it was a dangerous
sentiment to give expression to in a Russian café, though,
but for subsequent events, no importance would have been
attached to it.</p>

<p>With some difficulty the unfortunate man was taken to
his home, and it would appear that on the following day,
when no doubt he, figuratively speaking, sat on the stool
of repentance, he resolved, in his extremity, to appeal to
his whilom friend Riskoff. With that intention he went
to Riskoff’s house, but found that he was out; and, as it
was uncertain when he would return, Vassilo asked for pen
and paper, and wrote a letter, in which he confessed
that he had been living in a fools’ paradise. But he had
come to his senses, and intended to be more business-like
in future. He wound up with begging Riskoff to lend
him two thousand roubles, promising faithfully to repay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the loan in six months’ time. The following day he received
this reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Ivanoff</span>,</p>

<p>‘I confess to feeling some surprise, after the coolness
there has been between us of late, that you should apply
to me in your monetary difficulties for assistance. It is
true I have the reputation of being a rich man, and it is
highly probable that under different circumstances I would
have accommodated you with this loan. But I flatly refuse
to do so now. I do not consider you have treated me well.
I was your warm friend at one time, and would have done
anything for you; but you thought proper to trifle with
that friendship, so there’s an end of it. As you have made
your bed, so you must lie upon it. I don’t know that I am
an unkindly man—indeed, I am sure I am not; but I feel
angry now, and my heart hardens against you. I am truly
sorry for your beautiful wife, and consider that you have
done her a gross wrong in bringing her to this state of
poverty. It is no use your writing to me or calling here
again, as to-morrow morning I set off on my journey to
visit my estates, and shall not be back for a month. I
hope in the meantime you will pull through your difficulties,
and that the lesson which poverty teaches will not
be lost upon you.</p>

<p class="right">‘<span class="smcap">Riskoff</span>.’</p>
</div>

<p>It is easy to understand the effect a letter of this kind
would have upon a sensitive and proud man. The refusal
of his friend to help him must have been a stinging and
bitter blow to Ivanoff. It appeared that for a long time
he sat in moody and gloomy silence. Then he showed the
letter to his wife, and it was a shock to her. Up to that
moment she had not quite realized that things were as bad
as they were. Allowing her feelings to get the better of
her, she reproached her husband, and he made an angry
retort, with the inevitable result that other harsh things
were said on both sides, until the young wife, in a fit of
petulance and wounded pride, hastily put on her cloak and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
bonnet and went off to her parents. Soon afterwards the
unhappy husband also went out, and was absent for some
hours. In the evening his wife returned, accompanied by
her brother. She had repented her hastiness, and her
people had told her that her place was at her husband’s
side. In the meantime he also had come back. He seemed
in a much happier frame of mind, and Maria’s brother
witnessed a very pleasant reunion. He spent the evening
with her. They had supper, and were happy. Before retiring,
Vassilo told his wife that he was in funds again, and
all would be well. He said the little cloud that had over-shadowed
them had passed, and that henceforth they would
live in clover. She asked him how he had managed to so
suddenly bring about the change, but he laughingly replied
that he couldn’t explain just then, but would do so later on.</p>

<p>The next day Ivanoff rose betimes. He attended to
some business matters, paid several of the most pressing
claims against him, and at mid-day he and his wife lunched
at a café, and in the evening they dined at their own house
in company with some friends who had been invited. In
the midst of the dinner the company were suddenly startled
by the violent ringing of the large bell which hung at the
gate. It was by no means an ordinary ringing, but suggestive
of impatience and anger. The servant whose duty
it was to attend to the door had not time to get down
before the bell was rung a second time still more violently.
The servant hurried to the door, and, flinging it open, was
confronted by an important-looking official known as a
Judge of Instruction, accompanied by his two legal satellites
and two armed policemen.</p>

<p>‘Is your master in?’ demanded the Judge angrily.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean Mr. Vassilo Ivanoff?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I do. Why have you kept me so long at the
door?’</p>

<p>‘I came immediately, sir,’ answered the frightened
servant.</p>

<p>‘Very well. Now, is your master in?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Take me to him, then.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>‘He is dining with some friends.’</p>

<p>‘Blazes and thunder!’ roared the official; ‘what do I
care whether he is dining with friends or whether he isn’t?
Conduct me to him. Men, follow me.’</p>

<p>The now speechless servant led the way to the dining-room,
and close at her heels were the Judge and his men.
As the intruders thus unceremoniously entered, Vassilo
jumped to his feet, and his wife uttered a little cry of
alarm, while the visitors looked aghast, for the presence of
the Judge and the police with drawn swords was ominous.</p>

<p>‘Sorry to disturb you,’ growled the Judge gruffly.</p>

<p>‘What do you want here?’ asked Ivanoff sharply.</p>

<p>‘I’ve come on business.’</p>

<p>‘What business?’</p>

<p>‘Very unpleasant business. I am empowered to search
your house. Here is my authority.’ He displayed a blue
document bearing the Government seal.</p>

<p>Vassilo’s wife had recovered her presence of mind by this
time, and, going to her husband’s side, she remarked:</p>

<p>‘Oh, I suppose this is some absurd denunciation on the
part of an enemy, for I am afraid that even I and my
husband have enemies. But, happily for us, we never
interfere in politics; we are content to lead peaceful lives.’</p>

<p>‘It is not a question of politics,’ answered the Judge,
his gruff manner somewhat softening as he gazed upon the
beautiful young wife and felt sympathy for her.</p>

<p>‘Not politics!’ she exclaimed, in new alarm, as she
glanced at her husband’s face, which had become very pale.</p>

<p>‘No; my visit has nothing to do with politics.’</p>

<p>‘Why are you here, then?’ demanded Mrs. Ivanoff
anxiously.</p>

<p>‘I am here on very serious business indeed. Your husband
is accused of—well, that is, he is suspected of murder.’</p>

<p>‘Murder!’ broke like an echo from the wife’s lips, and
all present started to their feet in deadly alarm, as if a
bombshell had been exploded in the room.</p>

<p>‘I am accused of murder?’ gasped Ivanoff, looking
dazed, as if he had received a blow on the head that had
half stunned him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>‘Yes, murder,’ answered the Judge solemnly.</p>

<p>‘The murder of whom?’ asked the wife, a half-incredulous
smile on her face.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Riskoff.’</p>

<p>‘Riskoff!’ echoed the poor lady, as the smile gave place
to a look of terror, and she fixed her eyes on her husband
as if every hope she had on earth hung on the words he
would next utter.</p>

<p>‘Is he dead?’ Ivanoff gasped, the dazed expression
strengthening.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the Judge, ‘and you are charged with having
murdered him.’</p>

<p>Ivanoff broke into a strange laugh as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘This is positively absurd. Why, I was with him
yesterday.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that fact is well known. You went to his house
to see him?’</p>

<p>‘I did.’</p>

<p>‘No one was with him after you left him?’</p>

<p>‘That I have no knowledge of,’ moaned Ivanoff, as he
passed his hand distressfully over his head from his forehead
backward.</p>

<p>‘Soon after you had taken your departure from his
house he was found dead in his library.’</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Ivanoff was now almost in a state of collapse,
and would have fallen had not one of the ladies present
caught and supported her.</p>

<p>The Judge had become stern and hard again. His
assistants had out their note-books, and while one wrote
the questions and replies in shorthand, the other took
them down in longhand.</p>

<p>‘You possessed a revolver?’ asked the Judge.</p>

<p>‘I did,’ muttered Ivanoff.</p>

<p>‘Where is it?’</p>

<p>‘I—I lent it to—to my friend Riskoff.’</p>

<p>‘You lent it to him!’ exclaimed the Judge ironically.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Why did you lend it to him?’</p>

<p>‘Because he asked for it.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>‘Ah! very likely,’ remarked the Judge, still more
ironically. ‘Why did he ask you for it?’</p>

<p>‘He told me he was starting at once to visit his estates,
and as he was without a revolver mine would be useful to
him.’</p>

<p>‘Why did you take your revolver to his house?’</p>

<p>The Judge glanced at his assistants as he asked this
question, then fixed a searching glance on the suspected
man’s ghastly white face. Mrs. Ivanoff also gazed at her
husband with staring eyes, and waited breathlessly for
his answer. She had been led to a chair, and her friends
were crowding round her; but with outstretched arms
she kept them back, so that they might not obstruct her
view of her husband, who stood motionless as a statue,
save for the rapid rising and falling of his chest; and he
was white as a statue, while his hands were clenched firmly
together.</p>

<p>‘Give me an answer, sir,’ exclaimed the Judge angrily,
as the suspected man remained dumb. ‘Why did you
take your revolver with you to your friend’s house?’</p>

<p>Ivanoff was still silent. The assistants were busy writing.
The Judge became more peremptory.</p>

<p>‘Again I ask you: Why did you take your revolver to
Riskoff’s house?’</p>

<p>Ivanoff glanced nervously round the room now, and his
eyes fell upon his wife. The pitiable sight she presented
broke him down, and, covering his face with his hands,
he burst into tears, and stammered forth, in a broken,
emotional voice, the following reply:</p>

<p>‘I went to my friend to ask him to lend me some money.
I took the revolver with me, determining to shoot myself if
he refused.’</p>

<p>‘Or shoot him,’ said the Judge, with a sneer.</p>

<p>‘No, no—on my soul and before my God, no!’ cried
Ivanoff, raising his hands to heaven.</p>

<p>‘Well, your friend was killed with a bullet fired from
this revolver.’ He produced a revolver as he spoke. ‘Do
you recognise it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>‘Your name is engraved upon it. It was picked up on
the floor of his room. Riskoff had been shot in the back
of the head. The murderer, therefore, was behind him.’</p>

<p>A shudder ran through all present as this announcement
was made. There was an exception, however. It was
Mrs. Ivanoff; she sat motionless, as if she had been
petrified. Her eyes were still fixed on her husband.</p>

<p>‘Have you any money?’ asked the Judge.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered the wretched man.</p>

<p>‘In notes?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Let me see them.’</p>

<p>Ivanoff put his hands into his pocket, and produced a
well-filled pocket-book. The Judge took it, opened it, and
disclosed a packet of new notes. He examined them carefully,
and consulted certain memoranda he had made in his
note-book.</p>

<p>‘Ah, this is very damning evidence!’ he said at last.
‘Riskoff drew from his bankers yesterday a large sum
of money in notes. These notes are part of those he drew
from the bank.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Ivanoff started to her feet now, and uttered a low
moan of agony. Somebody wanted to support her, but
she pushed them back, and, steadying herself with a
tremendous effort, she said:</p>

<p>‘Vassilo, what does this mean?’</p>

<p>‘Some hideous mistake,’ he murmured.</p>

<p>‘I hope so. God grant it is so,’ sobbed the unhappy
lady. ‘But I remember Riskoff’s answer to your application
for a loan. And now Riskoff is dead, your revolver
is found in his house, and you are in possession of notes
which he drew from his bank. Oh, my God, it’s awful!
It’s too, too horrible! I am going mad!’</p>

<p>She uttered a suppressed scream, pressed her hands to
her head, reeled and staggered, and fell fainting into the
arms of some of her friends.</p>

<p>Apparently unmoved by this sad and pathetic scene, the
Judge preserved his sternness and stolidity.</p>

<p>‘So Riskoff wrote to you?’ he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>‘Yes,’ answered Ivanoff in a mechanical way.</p>

<p>‘Where is the letter?’</p>

<p>‘I will give it to you. Come with me.’</p>

<p>The Judge motioned to the armed men, and they placed
themselves one on either side of the suspect, while the
Judge himself brought up the rear. In this order they
proceeded to Ivanoff’s studio, where, opening a bureau with
a key he took from his pocket, he produced the letter he
had received from Riskoff, wherein he point-blank refused
to lend the money, and handed it to the Judge, who,
having perused it, remarked:</p>

<p>‘This is a fatal piece of evidence against you. You had
better make a clean breast of the whole affair.’</p>

<p>By this time Ivanoff had somewhat recovered himself,
and said firmly:</p>

<p>‘I have nothing to confess. I am innocent before God.’</p>

<p>‘Most criminals declare themselves innocent at first,’
answered the Judge coldly. ‘However, I have no doubt
you will tell another tale before we have done with you.
I charge you now with being the murderer of Mr. Riskoff, and
make you my prisoner. Secure him and bring him along.’</p>

<p>The policemen seized the wretched man, and fastened
his wrists together with a pair of handcuffs. He begged
to be allowed to write two or three letters, but this request
was refused, and he was taken from the house, still protesting
his innocence, and without being able to take a final
leave of his wife, who remained unconscious. In accordance
with the mode of procedure peculiar to Russia, the suspected
man was conducted to the office of the criminal
prison, where he was subjected to another cross-examination,
and the Judge of Instruction handed in his procès-verbal,
as the French call it. The Judge, having finished
his part of the affair so far, received an official receipt for
his prisoner’s body and left, while the prisoner himself,
having been stripped of his clothing, and a prison suit
allotted to him, was consigned to a secret cell, which
meant that he would be kept isolated from everyone until
the police had worked up sufficient evidence to secure his
conviction. But in the event of their failing to do that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the prisoner himself would in all probability ultimately
confess in order to be relieved from the awful horror of
solitary confinement in a secret dungeon.</p>

<p>The case against Ivanoff seemed perfectly clear. The
public condemned him from the first, for the evidence was
so strong. There was the letter which Riskoff had written
declining to lend the money Ivanoff had applied to him
for. Yet within thirty-six hours of that letter being
received, Riskoff was discovered dead in his own house.
He had that very morning drawn from his bank a large
sum of money. A portion of the money was found in
Ivanoff’s possession. Riskoff had been shot from behind.
A bullet had entered the back part of the head, traversing
the brain and producing instant death. The deed was
done with a revolver, which was left in the room, no doubt
by an oversight on the part of the slayer. The revolver
was the property of Ivanoff, as proved by a little silver
plate let into the butt, on which his name was engraved.
On his own confession, Ivanoff had visited Riskoff. He
knew that he was about to set out on a journey. He
knew also that he would draw money from the bank for
the purposes of his journey. Therefore, having been
refused the loan he had asked for, he went to the house
with the deliberate intention of killing his erstwhile friend
and robbing him of his money.</p>

<p>Such was the construction put upon the case, and it
seemed as if no one but an idiot could doubt for a moment
that Ivanoff had committed the crime. And as a piece of
strengthening evidence the words he had uttered in the
café were raked up against him. ‘It’s a burning shame,’
he had said, ‘that I should be poor when there are
thousands less worthy than I am rolling in wealth. I feel
as if I could do murder on those who hoard their gold
when so many are suffering for the want of common
necessaries.’</p>

<p>All these things taken into consideration left no room
to doubt that Ivanoff was a murderer. He had committed
a clumsy crime, and left such tracks behind him that in a
very short time the outraged law had him in its grip.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>The tragedy aroused more than the usual amount of
interest, as both Ivanoff and Riskoff were well known,
while the prisoner’s story was not without a certain
romance which added to the interest. His poetical tendencies;
his essays in art; his struggles; his wooing of
the beautiful Maria in opposition to the sage counsels and
earnest advice of his school-fellow and friend, Riskoff; his
marriage; his monetary difficulties; his appeal for help
to the man whose advice he had scouted—all these things
afforded the general public subject-matter for discussion;
they were so many chapters in an exciting tale, the end of
which was murder.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, Mrs. Ivanoff’s friends were furious,
for, though poor, they were as proud as Lucifer, and felt
strongly embittered against the man who had brought
such disgrace into the family. Poor Maria came in for a
fair amount of blame. She was told very bluntly that she
had no business ever to have married such a man. These
reproaches made her dreadful position still harder to bear;
but when the first shock of the disclosure and the arrest
had passed, she rose equal to the occasion, and startled
everyone she knew by declaring her unalterable belief in
her husband’s innocence. This seemed to most people like
flying in the very face of Providence. The accused man’s
guilt was so obvious that it was an outrage on intelligence
to argue otherwise. But Maria Ivanoff was a young and
newly-married woman. She had married for love. Her
husband had always treated her with the greatest tenderness
and consideration. Over and over again he had told
her he worshipped the very ground she walked upon, and
had done everything in his power to prove that he did not
speak mere words. She believed in him; she believed in
his assertion that he was innocent; and though all the
world condemned him she would not. She was his wife,
his loving wife, and she would try to save him. The poor
woman saw clearly enough that she stood alone, and that
she could expect neither sympathy nor help from anyone.
Nevertheless, she was not daunted, nor was she deterred,
and her first step was to seek an interview with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Minister of the Interior, or, as we should call him, the
Home Secretary. It was not easy to obtain this interview,
but thanks to the influence of a gentleman holding a high
official position, with whom she was acquainted, she succeeded
at last, and found herself face to face with the
proud and pompous personage who was invested with such
tremendous power that he could snatch a person from his
doom even at the eleventh hour. To the Minister she
pleaded, literally on her knees, for an order to visit her
husband. At first the official was obdurate; but her tears,
her eloquence, her distress, and perhaps, more than all, her
beauty, softened him; and she left his bureau with a
Government order which granted her a twenty minutes’
interview with the prisoner. She flew to the gloomy prison,
presented the order, and in a little while, in the presence
of numerous officials, husband and wife met again; but it
was in a dismal corridor, and they were separated from
each other by an iron grill.</p>

<p>Although only little more than a week had elapsed
since that cruel night when he was torn from her side, a
wonderful change had taken place in him. He looked
ten years older. He was haggard and ghastly, and no
wonder, for he had suddenly changed the sunshine and
brightness of the world for a pestiferous dungeon, far
below the ground, where every movement of the prisoner
was watched, where the walls were lined with felt to deaden
all sound; where miasma rose up from the ground, and
ooze and slime dropped from the roof; where no human
voice was heard, for the stern warders were prohibited
from opening their lips to a prisoner; where the food was
horrible, and even the common decencies of life were not
observed. No wonder that in such a place men went
mad; no wonder that even in a few weeks youth and
vigour were changed to tottering age.</p>

<p>Maria was startled and horrified. She would have
thrown her arms about her wretched husband’s neck, but
cruel bars kept them asunder. Ivanoff iterated and reiterated
again and again that he was innocent. He swore
it by all that a Russian holds most sacred, and he begged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
with streaming eyes that his wife would use every means
possible to prove his innocence and secure his release,
otherwise he would in a very short time be raving mad.</p>

<p>When Maria Ivanoff left that awful place and got into
the light again, she felt like one who had come up out of
a tomb, where she had looked upon death. She knew that
there was but little hope for her husband unless his innocence
was made clear as day. She thoroughly believed his
assertions; and she made a mental resolve that she would
rest neither night nor day until she had exhausted every
possible means to release him. Her friends were angry
with her; everybody said it was an impossible task to
prove a guilty man innocent. Her distress of mind may
be imagined, not described; she told her friends she herself
would go mad if somebody did not come to her assistance.
Then it was that her brother, with what he intended to be
the most pointed irony, said:</p>

<p>‘You are seeking to do that which is impossible. Now,
if there is a man in all Russia who can perform seemingly
impossible deeds, that man is Michael Danevitch, the
Government detective. Why don’t you go to him? He
might perform a miracle, who knows?’</p>

<p>Maria Ivanoff jumped at the suggestion, though it was
never intended she should take it seriously. But she
sought out Danevitch. She laid all the facts of the case
before him. It was the first he had heard of the matter.
It was the first time he had ever set his eyes on Maria.
But her moving tale stirred him; her beauty won him;
her tears found their way to his heart. He consoled her
in a measure by a pledge that he would examine the case
from every possible point of view, and communicate with
her later on. Nearly a fortnight passed before she saw
him again.</p>

<p>‘There is one point, and a very curious point it is,’ he
said, ‘that makes the evidence against the accused weak,
and yet nobody seems to have noticed it.’</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ cried Maria, breathless with new hope.</p>

<p>‘On the day that Riskoff was murdered, he drew from
the bank three thousand roubles. Your husband had one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
thousand of this sum, according to his own statement, and
the most critical investigation has failed to prove this
statement false; not a rouble over and above the one
thousand has been traced to his possession.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes; go on,’ moaned Maria, as she clasped her
hands together with the emotion the detective’s words
begot. ‘What has become of the other two thousand?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that is what I want to know. If your husband
murdered Riskoff for the sake of the money, why did he
only take one thousand roubles and leave two thousand?
And if he left two thousand behind, what has become of
them?’</p>

<p>Maria was holding her breath with that intensity of
nervous emotion which one experiences when it seems as
if some revelation is about to be made which means life
or death to the listener. Danevitch remained thoughtful
and silent. His eyes were fixed on vacancy; his lips were
closely compressed; he looked absorbed and dreamy, as
was his wont when he was unusually thoughtful. At last
Maria could endure her pent-up feelings no longer, and in
a husky voice she asked:</p>

<p>‘What inference do you draw?’</p>

<p>‘An inference which on the face of it seems to corroborate
your husband’s assertion of his innocence. Mark
you, I only say it seems to do so. I do not say it does.’</p>

<p>Maria covered her face with her hands and wept
passionately, but her tears were rather the result of hope
than of despair. Her over-strained nerves were in that
state when they were as liable to give way under the effects
of joy as they were under the effects of sorrow. She fell
on her knees at Danevitch’s feet, and, clasping her hands in
passionate appeal, implored him to save her husband. He
raised her up, and said softly:</p>

<p>‘I will do what I can.’</p>

<p>It was really remarkable that it should have been left
for Danevitch to bring out that curious point about the
money. All the police officials had overlooked it. They
were cock-sure, for they believed that the case was so clear
against the prisoner that it would not admit of a doubt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
For some days after the interview with Maria, Danevitch
concerned himself with endeavouring to prove if Ivanoff
had had more than the one thousand roubles, but the most
exhaustive inquiries, and the most rigorous search of his
house, failed to get a trace of a single rouble beyond the
one thousand which he had declared Riskoff had lent him,
a portion of which he had paid away to his creditors.
When it became known that Danevitch was engaged on
the case, and that he was trying to find out what had
become of the two thousand roubles out of the three
thousand drawn from the bank, not only was public
curiosity aroused, but to some extent opinion swung round,
and sympathy was expressed for the prisoner. The police,
however, were not moved, unless it was to become still
more prejudiced against Ivanoff. They knew the power of
Danevitch, and the influence he had in high quarters, and
they were determined not to lose their prey. They therefore
resorted to all the forms and pressure allowed by the
Russian law to exact from the unhappy man a confession
of his guilt. Beyond the facts they had already got
together, they could obtain no other evidence. They knew
that it was just possible those facts might fail to secure a
conviction, whereas a confession wrung from the suspected
man, no matter under what torture it was obtained, would
be accepted without question. Such was the law in
Russia.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, and it leaked out that the prisoner’s
obstinacy had at last been overcome. All that remained,
therefore, to be done was to bring him up for trial, which
would be a mere perfunctory business, and fix the date for
his transportation. At last he appeared before the judges.
The interest the case had aroused caused the court to be
crowded to suffocation. When the prisoner appeared at
the bar, those who had known Ivanoff previous to his arrest
were shocked. They saw now an old white-haired man, with
a haggard, hunted expression of face, and a wild stare in the
restless eyes, as if he had suffered some tremendous mental
shock. He seemed stunned, and as if he did not recognise
anyone, and could not realize his position. Truly it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
said of him who is sent to a Russian dungeon: ‘He shall
return no more to his house, neither shall his place know
him any more.’ The prisoner had been chained, tortured,
and punished until he had become imbecile. But what of
that? Was he not the slayer of a fellow-man—a scarlet-handed
murderer who for the sake of a comparatively small
sum of money had ruthlessly taken the life of his best
friend? He himself had confessed to it, so that no one
could raise up a doubt. The counsel for the prosecution
seemed to have an easy task of it. He went over all the
evidence that was known. Ivanoff had applied to his
friend for a loan; the loan was refused, and the letter of
refusal was read in court with a great flourish. Nevertheless,
the prisoner went to his friend’s house, taking a
revolver engraved with his own name with him. What
passed between them would never be known until the
secrets of all hearts were revealed; but a little later
Riskoff was found dead. Some distance from him was
Ivanoff’s revolver. The dead man had been shot with a
bullet from that revolver. The bullet had gone through
his brain. By an inconceivable act of folly, the prisoner
left his revolver behind. It must have fallen from his
hand when he was rifling the victim’s pockets for the
money, and he had forgotten to pick it up. Subsequently
the money was found in his possession. Was ever there
clearer circumstantial evidence in the world? But to make
assurance doubly sure, there was the prisoner’s confession,
taken down from his own lips in his cell, by the Judge of
Instruction; there it was for the jury to inspect, duly
witnessed and attested and legalized by the great seal of
the Minister of the Interior.</p>

<p>The prosecuting counsel sat down with the air of one
who had performed a noble deed and scored a great
triumph. The prisoner was silent, motionless, his eyes
staring blankly into space, and his white face without any
expression. Amidst a hush that was painful, the counsel
for the defence—one of the ablest men in Russia—rose to
his feet, and, adjusting his gown with professional gravity,
said: ‘I claim one of two things: either an immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
acquittal of the prisoner on the grounds of lack of condemnatory
evidence, or an adjournment of the trial for a
few days, when I shall be able to prove his innocence. As
everyone knows, Riskoff, the murdered man, drew three
thousand roubles from his bankers on the morning of his
death. One thousand roubles only was traced to the
prisoner. All the money was in small notes. I have here
one thousand five hundred of the missing two thousand.
There are witnesses present from the bank who will identify
every note. We hope to regain the other five hundred
shortly. These notes were not in possession of the
prisoner, but of another man, the man who committed the
murder, and who will yet be brought to justice. The
prisoner at the bar is innocent.’</p>

<p>The effect of this announcement was startling and
dramatic in the highest degree. Everybody seemed affected
except the prisoner—he was unmoved; he continued to
stare into space. There was a hasty consultation among
the jury, and a hurried whispering with the Judge, who
asked if it was true that Michael Danevitch had the case
in hand. He was answered in the affirmative, and in the
end he announced that no verdict would be given that day,
but the prisoner would be put back for a fortnight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ivanoff had not been present at her husband’s
trial. She was prostrated with illness, the result of long
mental strain and intense anxiety; but a day or two before
the case came on Danevitch called upon her and bade her
be of good cheer, for her husband was innocent. Although
she knew that Danevitch was not likely to make such a
definite statement as that without warrant, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘But it is rumoured that my husband has confessed the
crime.’</p>

<p>‘I have heard the same rumour,’ Danevitch answered;
‘but a confession that is wrung from a prisoner is not
always reliable. But come, now, take heart. I told you,
in the first instance, that I was much struck by the fact
that only one thousand roubles could be traced to your
husband. If he murdered his friend for his money, why
did he not take the lot? It seemed absurd that, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
committed the crime, he contented himself with one-third
only of the amount he could have had. His story was
that he visited Riskoff, who repented of his hastiness, and
said he had written the letter of refusal when he was in a
bad temper, and that had your husband not called, he was
going to write an apology to him and enclose him one
thousand roubles. As it was, he handed him the money,
for which your husband gave a receipt as an acknowledgment
that he was indebted to Riskoff to the extent of
a thousand roubles. Subsequently, on Riskoff saying he
was going to a gunsmith’s to buy a gun and a revolver to
take with him on his journey, your husband pulled his
own revolver out and offered the loan of it to his friend.
The offer was accepted, and soon afterwards the two men
parted. On the first blush this story had the appearance
of being very far-fetched, and calculated to tax one’s
credulity; but when I came to examine it in connection
with all the circumstances, it presented itself to me as a
statement of fact. Now I have no hesitation in saying
that in the main, if not in actual detail, it is true.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Ivanoff heard this in silent thankfulness. She felt
that her prayers had been heard, for night and day the
poor woman had prayed that her husband might be proved
innocent. Like most Russian women, she had an intense
faith in the rites of her Church and the efficacy of prayer.
Needless to say that after Danevitch’s statement her faith
was strengthened, for she knew he was not the man to express
such a pronounced opinion without he had a very
good foundation for it.</p>

<p>As he himself had said, when he came to look into the
matter the case presented itself to him in a very different
aspect, and the prisoner’s story appeared probable. If
that story was true, it necessarily followed that a third
person must have been aware of the monetary transaction
between the two men, and, taking advantage of the circumstances,
had himself committed the crime for the sake of
the two thousand roubles. It was upon that theory that
Danevitch set to work. Riskoff led a bachelor life. His
household consisted of two female servants and a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
servant. On the morning of the crime the man had gone
to the market. One of the females was an old woman
who had been in the service of the family for upwards of
fifty years, and had nursed Riskoff when he was a baby;
the other was a young girl of about eighteen. The old
woman at the time was in bed suffering from an ulcerated
foot, the result of a cut with a piece of glass on which she
had inadvertently stepped. Consequently the girl—Olga
was her name—was in charge of the house. She admitted
Ivanoff, and very soon afterwards her master and the visitor
went out, and were absent nearly an hour. Her master
told her that he was going to the bank to draw some
money for his journey on the morrow. The two men returned
together. In about half an hour afterwards she
opened the door for Ivanoff to depart. The murder was
not discovered until the return of the man-servant. Then
Olga went to her master’s room to inquire whether he intended
to dine alone that evening or whether there would
be guests. On opening the door, she was horrified to find
her master lying dead on the floor.</p>

<p>Such was Olga’s story, and it seemed probable enough,
but Danevitch was not satisfied. The missing two thousand
roubles set him pondering deeply, and he had a private
interview with the old housekeeper, and questioned her
about Olga.</p>

<p>‘Was Olga a steady girl?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Had she a lover?’</p>

<p>The old woman thought not; at any rate, no one who
came to the house. But did nobody visit her? Well,
yes, a brother had been to see her the previous day. Her
brother was called Andrey. He was a soldier stationed at
Cronstadt, but was on furlough, and passed through St.
Petersburg on his way to visit his parents, who resided
at a place called Ladeinoe Pole, a little village lying
to the north of St. Petersburg and the east of Lake
Ladoga.</p>

<p>‘Was the brother at the house on the day of the
murder?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>The housekeeper did not know. She thought not. But,
still, he might have been without her knowing it.</p>

<p>Pursuing his inquiries, Danevitch found that this soldier
brother had left St. Petersburg on the night of the murder
for his home. Danevitch followed him there, but found on
his arrival that, his furlough being up, he had returned to
Cronstadt. The parents were peasants, and, like most
Russian peasants, living a miserable sort of life; but
Danevitch learnt this fact, that quite recently they had
been to a neighbouring market-town and purchased a horse
and two cows, which made the neighbours quite envious;
and, of course, such an event in so small a village was a
nine days’ wonder, and was much commented upon. The
soldier son, who was so good to his parents, had no doubt
provided them with the money. Danevitch, however, was
well aware that, however dutiful and affectionate the son
was, he could not save from his miserable pay a sum sufficiently
large for the purchase of two cows and a horse.
The pay of the Russian private is about one halfpenny a
day. It is therefore impossible for him to save money.
Having regard to these facts, the detective deemed some
explanation imperatively necessary. But before he took
his departure from the little village, it came to his knowledge
that Andreyvitch, the father of Andrey, the soldier,
was carrying on negotiations with a Jew—Weissmann by
name—a nationalized German, for the purchase of a little
plot of land in the village. Weissmann had had a mortgage
on the land, had foreclosed, and was anxious to sell. At
last a bargain was struck, and Andreyvitch paid one
hundred roubles as earnest money. The hundred roubles
was paid in notes. They formed part of the amount
Riskoff had drawn from the bank. Thereupon Danevitch
confronted old Andreyvitch with two armed officers of the
law, and demanded to know where he got those notes from.
The simple and ignorant old peasant at once answered that
he had received them from his son.</p>

<p>‘Where did the son get them from?’</p>

<p>The father understood that his son had found a roll of
notes, and though he ought to have delivered them at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
bureau of police, his strong affection for his poor old
parents prompted him to commit a breach of the law by
retaining the money and giving it to his father.</p>

<p>‘Had the father any more notes?’</p>

<p>Yes, he had a roll of them. He produced them from a
hole in the thatch of his house. They were carefully
wrapped up in a piece of sheepskin to keep them from the
damp. There were notes to the value of one thousand five
hundred roubles. The old people had already spent about
five hundred roubles in the purchase of the cows and the
horse, and in clearing off certain debts. To the astonishment
and terror of the old people, the notes were retained,
and steps were taken to recover those that had already been
paid away.</p>

<p>With the money in his possession, Danevitch returned
to St. Petersburg, and handed it over to the defending
counsel in time for him to make that dramatic <i>coup</i> in
court. The next step was the arrest of Olga and Andrey.
They were arrested simultaneously, though one was in St.
Petersburg, the other in Cronstadt. The woman was
terrified at first, but when she was confronted with the
Judge of Instruction, she became sullen, and refused to
answer any questions. Not so Andrey; he at once confessed
that he had stolen the money, but vowed that he did
not commit the murder.</p>

<p>‘Who did commit the murder, then?’</p>

<p>He believed that Ivanoff did. All that he knew about
it was what his sweetheart had told him; she said she had
found her master shot. He was lying on the floor with a
bullet-wound in the head, and on the table was a pile of
bank-notes. She asked him to go to the room and take
the notes, which he did.</p>

<p>Danevitch saw at once the discrepancies in this story.
It was not at all likely that Ivanoff would have gone off
leaving a large number of bank-notes on the table. So
Olga and Andrey were each consigned to a secret dungeon.
In the course of a week the discipline of the dungeon life
had worked its effects on Olga, and with blanched lips she
related the following story to the Judge of Instruction.</p>

<p>Her soldier lover had come to see her two days before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the crime, and, unknown to her master, she had kept him
in the house during those two days. On the morning of
the crime, when her master and Ivanoff returned from the
bank, she had to go into the room to take in some refreshments.
She saw a great heap of notes on the table; she
heard the conversation about the revolver, and saw Ivanoff
hand his to her master. When the visitor had departed
and she had closed the door upon him, she thought how
easy it would be to murder the master, take his money,
and let it seem as if Ivanoff had done it. Her fellow-servant
was ill in bed; the man-servant was out. Her lover
was at hand, and nobody knew that he was there. She
hurried to him. She told him all. He was entirely under
her influence. She went to her master’s room again. The
notes were still on the table, so was the revolver. He was
busy making up his books, and did not seem to notice her.
As she removed a tray containing glasses and biscuits, she
secretly took away the revolver also. Then she flew to
Andrey, gave him the weapon, and they returned to the
room. She opened the door gently; Riskoff was sitting
at the table, still writing. Andrey crept in on his hands
and knees and shot him. He took the notes and the
receipt given by Ivanoff to his friend for the thousand
roubles, and immediately left the house. In six months’
time he would be drafted into the reserve; then he and
Olga would be married, and go to live with his people.
Nobody would suspect them of the crime. The case was
clear against Ivanoff; he would probably die, and there
would be an end of it, for dead men tell no tales.</p>

<p>All would no doubt have turned out just as the wretches
desired, had Danevitch not been brought upon the scene.
The horrible story as told by Olga was corroborated in
every detail, and the receipt given to Riskoff by Ivanoff
was recovered. Andrey expiated his crime in the mines.
Olga was sent to Northern Siberia for life. Ivanoff was
released, but he was a mental wreck, and his loving and
devoted wife had to place him in a lunatic asylum.
Danevitch had saved him from Siberia, but could not
save him from the living death to which a cruel fate had
doomed him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE MERCHANT OF RIGA.</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Ferguson, Tauchnitz and Co.</span> were the largest firm of
exporters in Riga. Their trade consisted of tallow, timber,
corn, flax, hemp, flax-seed, quills, furs, etc. They had
agents all over the great Russian Empire, including the
far eastern and far northern parts of Siberia. The
trade was principally with Great Britain, and it was said
the firm employed a fleet of upwards of a hundred steam
and sailing vessels, besides numerous small craft for the
navigation of the Russian rivers.</p>

<p>Donald Ferguson, the head of the firm, was a Scotchman,
naturalized in Russia, where he had lived for nearly
forty years. He had married a Russian lady, by whom he
had several children.</p>

<p>Ferguson enjoyed the distinction of being reputed one
of the wealthiest merchants in Russia, and he was no less
conspicuous as a prominent citizen, who had done an
immense deal for his adopted country. For many years he
had taken a very active part in all philanthropic movements.
He had spent large sums of money in the improvement
of Riga and its harbour; he had built and endowed
a national hospital; had founded schools, and done much
for the improvement of the lower classes, whose cause he
espoused with great warmth and enthusiasm. He had
earned for himself, from one end of Russia to the other, a
name for fair dealing, probity, and honourable conduct.
In the mercantile world he and his firm were held in the
highest repute.</p>

<p>One night at the beginning of spring he was found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
lying dead in his private office at his warehouse on the
quay at Riga. It was thought at first that he had died a
natural death, that he had had an apoplectic seizure; but
when the body came to be examined, there was conclusive
evidence of his having been strangled. On each side of
the throat were unmistakable signs of thumb pressure, and
a post-mortem examination made it clear that strangulation
had caused death. Such a prominent and well-known
man could not have died in an ordinary way without his
fellow-citizens experiencing a shock and being deeply
affected, but when the news spread that he had been
murdered it caused a profound sensation. Then there
was a universal expression of regret, followed by a cry of
indignation and horror, and a demand for vengeance, swift
and pitiless, on the slayer of this good man. Naturally
enough, the first thought was that he had been killed in
order that some of his property might be carried off, but
a little investigation soon put a very different complexion
on the affair, and proved that the crime was mysterious,
inexplicable, and remarkable. When many hours had
passed, and no trace of the murderer could be got, Michael
Danevitch was communicated with.</p>

<p>The warehouse of Ferguson, Tauchnitz and Co. was an
immense block of buildings on the Grand Quay at Riga.
The counting-house was in the very centre of the block,
and faced the quay and the harbour. Adjoining, but at
the back of the counting-house, was Mr. Ferguson’s
private room. This room was lighted by a large window
overlooking a covered-in courtyard. On three sides of this
yard were platforms provided with cranes and communicating
with different floors, and it was here that carts and
waggons were loaded and unloaded.</p>

<p>Frequently when business was very brisk, work was
carried on all night at the warehouse; but the murder was
committed in the early spring, when the export trade was
only beginning, and the usual hour for closing up was six
o’clock, and three o’clock on Saturdays. Mr. Ferguson met
his death on Saturday, March 3, about seven o’clock. He
was the last to leave the office, as he remained behind to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
close up some business he was engaged upon. It was then
four o’clock, or thereabouts. He proceeded to his home
on foot, being greeted on the way by many people who
knew him.</p>

<p>His private residence was in the suburbs of Riga. His
family at home consisted of his wife, two grown-up sons,
and two daughters. He had two other sons, one being
established in Hull as the English agent of the firm.
The other travelled all over Russia, and was absent at the
time of his father’s death. On arriving at his home,
Mr. Ferguson partook of some refreshment. He then
told his wife that he had suddenly remembered something
of importance he neglected to do at the office, and he
would go back. He did not say what this something was.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferguson asked her husband how long he was
likely to be, and he answered that he would return in an
hour, or an hour and a half at the outside. When
he left his house it was a few minutes past five. At
this time his sons were out. They arrived a little after
seven, and as their father had not returned, they set off,
expecting to meet him. Failing to do that, they went on
to the warehouse. On arriving there they were surprised
to find the main entrance door slightly ajar. They pushed
it open and entered. The place was in pitch darkness, and
there was unbroken silence. They naturally thought there
was something wrong, otherwise the door would not have
been open, but did not feel any alarm. They groped their
way to their father’s room. Darkness and silence there.
In moving about, Donald, the elder of the two, struck his
feet against something soft and yielding; he started back
with a cry of horror.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter?’ asked James, the younger one.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ answered Donald; ‘but I believe there
is a body lying on the floor.’</p>

<p>The young man procured a light as speedily as possible.
Then was revealed to them sure enough the sight of their
father lying on his back, with his left leg up, and his right
arm bent under his body. At first the sons thought he
had fainted, but the peculiar and ghastly appearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
his face soon undeceived them, and when they touched him
they had painful evidence that their worst fears were well
founded. Terribly alarmed, they rushed out and sought
assistance, which was soon forthcoming. The police were
informed and a doctor was procured. The latter at once
said that Mr. Ferguson was dead, that he had been dead
about an hour. The time then was a little after eight
o’clock.</p>

<p>‘What has my father died of?’ asked Donald.</p>

<p>‘I am not prepared to say right off,’ said the doctor,
‘but I suggest apoplexy.’</p>

<p>Ferguson was a fine man. He was above medium
height, well proportioned, muscular, and looked much
younger than his years. His age was sixty-eight. He
had gray hair, and a long flowing beard turning gray.</p>

<p>It was now noted by all present that the place was in
great disorder. Ledgers, cash-books, and other books
were lying in a confused jumble on the floor; papers and
documents were scattered about in a very unbusiness-like
way on the desk. A large safe was open, and its contents
of papers and books had been hastily dragged out. These
signs were suggestive of robbery, and the doctor was induced
thereby to make a more thorough examination of
Mr. Ferguson’s body. For this purpose the dead man was
carried into a packing-room and placed on a counter.
Then the medical man noticed the marks on the neck, and
having satisfied himself that he was correct, he said it was
a case of murder; Ferguson had been strangled, and there
were indications of great force and strength having been
used. Several scratches were noticeable on the dead man’s
hands, and abrasions on his head, from which a little
blood had flowed. These things had escaped the doctor’s
notice in the uncertain light, but were revealed on closer
inspection. They were suggestive of a struggle, a fight for
life, and this was corroborated by the way things were
scattered about the room.</p>

<p>Other policemen were now brought in, and means were
taken to ascertain to what extent robbery had been committed;
but, strangely enough, on the desk was a cash-box.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
It was open, and contained a considerable sum of
money. In the safe, so conspicuous that it could not have
been overlooked by the eager eyes of a thief who had committed
murder in order to rob, was a leather bag full of
money. Apparently the bag had not been touched; the
mouth was still tied up with tape. On Mr. Ferguson’s
person were many valuables, including money. It was
difficult to understand how all this money should have remained
untouched, if the deed of violence was the result of
greed for gain. Why did the criminal, having committed
murder, not avail himself of the hoard that lay to his
hand? The investigators were naturally puzzled in the
face of such an inexplicable state of matters.</p>

<p>In the meantime Ferguson’s partners had been communicated
with, and arrived on the scene as speedily as
possible. When they had made an examination, they
expressed an opinion that nothing had been taken away.
That the deceased had been murdered was evident; that
no robbery had been committed was scarcely less evident.
Here was a problem at once.</p>

<p>Did the murderer enter the premises to rob, and, finding
the master there, slay him, and having done this
fearful deed, did he become so indifferent to his first
intent as to go off without the blood-money, which was
there for the taking? Having realized the extent of his
crime, was he so appalled that in his eagerness to escape
from the awful scene he forgot the gold? Such a thing
might be possible, but it didn’t seem probable. At any
rate, it was hardly in accordance with the principles of
debased human nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Tauchnitz, the second partner, who was intimately
acquainted with the working of the business, and had been
with Ferguson most of that day, could suggest no reason
why the deceased should have gone back to the warehouse.
He had never been known to do such a thing before.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, it was a dreadful night for the
friends and relatives of the deceased; and the hour being
so late when the discovery was made, the police were placed
at a tremendous disadvantage. Riga is a large place. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
is a populous and busy seaport, doing an enormous trade
with other parts of Europe. An immense number of ships
of various nationalities were lying in the harbour. As in
all maritime places, there was a very rough element always
prominent in the town, and after dark many shameful and
brutal scenes took place. In addition to the sailors who
came and went, there was always a large garrison, for the
town is strongly fortified. So what with sailors and
soldiers, and the nondescript hangers-on who are always to
be found in their wake, law and order were not so well
observed as in some other towns; and it will be understood
that in the low quarters of such a place a criminal
might find safe refuge from pursuing justice. In the
instance we are dealing with, all the police could do was to
notify the facts to their agents and spies as speedily as
possible; but, necessarily, this was the work of hours; and
through the long, dreary winter night—for, though nominally
spring, the winter still lingered, though the ice had
broken up—not much could be done. This, of course, was
all in favour of the criminal. He had a big start, and
unless he was absolutely a fool he would avail himself of
his advantages.</p>

<p>The murder was supposed to have been committed about
seven. The discovery was made a little after eight, but it
was after nine—in fact, close upon ten—before the police
really began to bestir themselves. During the time from
half-past six to ten, several trains had left the town, vessels
had left the harbour, and vehicles innumerable were driven
forth in all directions. It will thus be seen that the
murderer had many roads of escape open to him, and it
could not be doubted that, if he was really desirous of
saving his neck, he would avail himself of the chance he
had to get clear.</p>

<p>That the murder was brutal could not be gainsaid; but
on the face of it the crime was not one of the ordinary
type. Danevitch’s preliminary investigations led him to
the conclusion that the motive which had prompted the
deed was not robbery. That admitted—and there was
evidence of it—the case was invested with a certain mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
suggestive of many things. Tauchnitz and the other partners
were questioned by Danevitch as to why Mr. Ferguson
had remained behind at the office on that fatal Saturday
afternoon, when everybody else had gone. No satisfactory
answer could be given to this question. Tauchnitz, who
had been with Ferguson all the morning, declared that
there was no reason whatever, as far as the business was
concerned, why the ill-fated man should have stayed at the
office.</p>

<p>‘Was he in the habit of staying?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Was he a methodical man?’</p>

<p>‘Most methodical.’</p>

<p>‘Was he given to making confidants?’</p>

<p>‘No. He was very reticent.’</p>

<p>‘But he bore the reputation of being straightforward,
honest, upright, and just?’</p>

<p>‘Unquestionably. He won the respect of all men. His
character, so far as one knew, was without blemish.’</p>

<p>The members of the dead man’s family spoke of him
with profound sorrow and regret. He had proved himself
a model husband, a kind, indulgent father, and though he
was not communicative, either to his family or anyone else,
no importance was attached to that. It was his nature to
be somewhat silent and reserved.</p>

<p>Furnished with these meagre particulars, Danevitch
began his work. From the first he formed the opinion
that there was a deep and underlying motive for the crime,
which, however, he did not consider was premeditated.
And his reason for so thinking was this: A man who
deliberately sets forth to slay another in cold blood generally
provides himself with some lethal weapon. In this case
the slayer would hardly have trusted entirely to his hands,
unless he was a man of gigantic strength; for though
Ferguson was well advanced in years, he was not only
unusually vigorous, but unusually powerful. He was
known also to be determined, resolute, fearless. Such a
person was not likely to yield up his life easily. Consequently,
anyone who was acquainted with him would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
surely have hesitated before engaging in a personal encounter.
Of course it may be suggested that the murderer
was an utter stranger, and knew nothing of his victim.
But that was not the opinion of Danevitch, whose deductions
were as follows:</p>

<p>Firstly, the murder was unpremeditated.</p>

<p>Secondly, the murderer met his victim by appointment.
There were several reasons for thinking this. It was
Saturday afternoon, and Ferguson had never been known
to go back to the office after it was closed on Saturday
afternoon before. His partners were emphatic in saying that
there was nothing in connection with the business which
required his personal attention at that time. No valuables
having been carried off, so far as could be ascertained, and
the confusion in which the papers were found, pointed to
the motive being a desire on the part of the murderer to
obtain possession of some document which certain circumstances
and conditions, not definable at that stage, gave a
greater importance to than money.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the victim and the murderer having failed to
agree upon some point, and the former, perhaps, proving
stubborn and immovable, the latter, in a sudden frenzy of
passion, fell upon him, and got so much advantage in the
very initial stage of the struggle that he was enabled to
conquer with comparative ease, although the victim had
made an effort to free himself from the death-grip.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the crime having been thus accomplished, and
without forethought, the criminal, agitated and filled with
fear and alarm, frantically turned over papers and books,
and rummaged the contents of the safe, in his eager desire
to find what he wanted. Finally, without discovering
what he wanted to discover probably, he fled, and in his
hurry and confusion forgot to close the door after him.</p>

<p>The foregoing was the line of reasoning that Danevitch
pursued, but he kept it to himself. It was absolutely and
entirely opposed to public opinion, and to the theories set
forth by the police.</p>

<p>As is invariably the case at such times, some very wild
suggestions were made; but there was a general tendency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
to believe that robbery was responsible for the crime, notwithstanding
that nothing appeared to be missing. But
public opinion did not influence Danevitch. He saw with
his own eyes and thought with his own brains, and he
came to the conclusion that he would probably find the
key to the puzzle if he knew more of Mr. Ferguson’s
private life. There, of course, he was at once confronted
with great difficulty. Everyone spoke well of the victim.
His family believed him perfect. For Danevitch, therefore,
to have breathed a word calculated to tarnish, even
by suggestion, the fair fame of this merchant prince and
good citizen would have been to incur odium and ill-will.
But he knew human nature too well to run any such risk
for the sake of a mere hypothesis. The problem, however,
had to be solved if possible, and he proceeded upon
his own lines to search for a tangible clue.</p>

<p>In taking up a case of this kind, one must ever feel in
the initial stage that he is groping in the dark; but the
trained mind at once begins to reason the matter out, and
the very first thing sought for is a feasible and probable
motive. Motive is the very keynote in all detective work,
and when the motive has been more or less accurately
guessed, the next stage is to try and determine who was
likely to have been actuated by that motive. These
remarks necessarily apply to complicated cases, where the
mystery surrounding them seems impenetrable. When a
man is found murdered in his house, and his valuables
have been carried off, the motive is apparent enough.
That is a crime of mere vulgar sordidness, and the motive
is writ large. All crime is, of course, more or less vulgar,
but sordidness is not always the actuating influence.
Whether sordidness was or was not at the bottom of this
Riga crime, it was difficult at that stage to say; but the
inquirer was confronted with the remarkable fact that
nothing seemed to have been stolen.</p>

<p>In spite of the many rumours of this, that, and the
other, and the various opinions expressed, all of which
were counter to his own views, Danevitch remained uninfluenced
by them, and adhered to the opinion he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
formed, which, as I have endeavoured to show, was based
on sound reasoning. The many documents scattered about
the office where the murder took place, although carefully
examined by Danevitch, did not help the inquiry, as they
were all business papers, and obviously had been discarded
by the murderer as of no value to him. They had been
dragged rudely out of the large safe, and scattered broadcast
on the ground. Now, that was either the act of a
madman, or of someone who was searching hurriedly for
something he knew or believed to exist, and which he expected
to find in the safe.</p>

<p>Danevitch’s next step was to examine the contents of a
large waste-paper basket that stood in the office. The
basket was full of paper, torn and otherwise. He records
that this proceeding of his was regarded as an absolutely
useless one; but those who condemned it did not know
what he was looking for. I have already said that, in
weighing all the particulars he had gathered up so far, he
formed an opinion that Mr. Ferguson had returned to his
office to meet somebody by appointment. The reasons for
this opinion have been set forth. One of his strong points
was, having formed an opinion, which he never did until
after much reflection, and a very careful examination of all
details, so far as he could gather them up, he would not
swerve from that opinion until he had proved it wrong;
and as soon as ever he was convinced that he was in error,
he was always ready to admit it.</p>

<p>It is strong testimony to the wonderful perseverance and
patience of the man that every scrap of paper in the basket
was carefully examined. Amongst the great mass he found
some fragments which attracted his attention. One scrap
bore the following words: ‘Door at five.’ It was a coarse,
common enough paper, of Russian make, and the formation
of the letters indicated that the writer was an uneducated
person. With infinite trouble and pains he searched for
the corresponding morsels of paper. And if anyone wants
to know what a difficult task it was, let him fill a basket
with fragments and shreds of paper, shake them well up,
and then endeavour to pick out certain pieces and fit them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
together. No Chinese puzzle, complicated and ingenious
as most of them are, was ever harder to do. But human
ingenuity, coupled with exemplary patience, will accomplish
much, and Danevitch at last succeeded in getting all the
scraps together. Then he pasted them in their proper
order on a sheet of foolscap, and was thus enabled to read
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘This is the last chance I shall give you. You must see
me. I will be opposite your warehouse door at five on
Saturday. We can then discuss the matter alone and undisturbed.
You need not try to shuffle me off. If you
fail to do justice to those you have wronged, I will make
the whole affair public. So stay away at your peril.’</p>
</div>

<p>The importance of this discovery could not be overrated;
and it not only gave Danevitch a clue, but proved him
right in his surmises. The letter was clearly a laboured
one. It was a man’s handwriting, and the writer showed
that he was not a practised correspondent. There were
smudges and smears, and words wrongly spelt, although in
the translation given above it has been deemed advisable
to give the correct spelling, because in rendering it from
the original into English, if the inaccuracies were retained,
all sense would be lost to the reader.</p>

<p>It was very evident now to Danevitch that Ferguson had
had a secret—the secret of some dark transaction, which
placed him so far in the power of an uneducated person
that he had obeyed the command to go to the office, after
all was closed up for the day, in order to hold an interview
with the writer, who neither dated his missive nor signed
his name.</p>

<p>Of course Danevitch kept this discovery to himself; and
he set to work with all the caution and skill for which he
was famed to get some accurate and reliable information
of Ferguson’s disposition and his peculiarities of temperament.
Everyone spoke highly of him—indeed, there
seemed a general desire to belaud him, even beyond his
merits, perhaps. In common phraseology, his word was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
considered as good as his bond. His acts were above
suspicion; he was eminently respectable; he was charitable,
though there was a feeling that there was a tendency to
ostentation in his giving. In other words, he could hardly
be ranked amongst that class of men who will not let their
right hand know what their left hand gives. His marked
peculiarities were an obstinately strong will, and his refusal
to budge from a position he had once taken up. In this
Danevitch saw a probable cause of the crime, when it was
taken in consideration with the letter. The writer had
not premeditated the crime, but had been exasperated into
madness by Ferguson’s obstinacy. This was the detective’s
first deduction, and as he advanced step by step it seemed
to receive remarkable confirmation. Finally, as an estimate
of Ferguson’s character, he was regarded as a faithful and
honourable husband, an affectionate father, a loyal friend.
Amongst his workpeople he was looked up to with respect,
if not with actual affection. He was, however, thought an
exacting master, requiring the full measure of labour he
bargained for; but that rendered, he could be considerate
enough, and, in fact, did much for the physical and moral
welfare of those who served him.</p>

<p>Danevitch had now reached a stage in his investigation
when he could congratulate himself on having obtained a
clue. It is true it was a slender one, but to such a man it
was of great value. He found himself handicapped, however,
by the very obvious disadvantage he would be placed
in if he had ventured to suggest that there was a flaw in
Ferguson’s character—that he had done something or other
which had placed him in the power of a person who was
far below him in the social scale. Whatever the error was
he had committed, it was clearly serious enough to draw
him back to his warehouse after business hours, in order to
have a clandestine interview with that person. As showing
Danevitch’s difficulty, it is worth while recording a conversation
he had with Mr. Tauchnitz, who, as his name
implies, was a German—a very shrewd, long-headed fellow,
who held his partner in the highest estimation. Tauchnitz
had been associated with Ferguson in business for a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
many years, and he claimed to know and understand him
better than anyone else outside his own family.</p>

<p>‘Do you think, Mr. Tauchnitz,’ Danevitch asked—‘do
you think that your late lamented partner had by some
rash act compromised himself to such an extent with an
inferior as to be completely in the power of that inferior?’</p>

<p>Tauchnitz looked as though a thunderbolt had suddenly
fallen at his feet, and Danevitch had to repeat his question.
The answer was an emphatic, ‘No. Certainly not. I
believe that Ferguson was absolutely incapable of anything
of the kind.’</p>

<p>‘You had the most perfect faith in him as a business man?’</p>

<p>‘Indeed I had.’</p>

<p>‘His business integrity was above suspicion?’</p>

<p>‘Undoubtedly.’</p>

<p>‘He concealed nothing from you you were entitled to
know?’</p>

<p>‘I have no hesitation in saying he did not.’</p>

<p>‘Nevertheless, he was regarded as a reticent man.’</p>

<p>‘About his own affairs he certainly was reticent.’</p>

<p>‘Now, if I were to suggest he had been guilty of some
dishonourable action, what would you say?’</p>

<p>‘I should say you were doing the man a gross injustice,’
replied Tauchnitz warmly.</p>

<p>‘Had you free access to all the books and papers relating
to the business?’</p>

<p>‘Undoubtedly.’</p>

<p>‘But is it possible that Mr. Ferguson had transactions
in his office of which you knew nothing?’</p>

<p>‘I won’t admit the possibility at all,’ answered Tauchnitz,
waxing wroth.</p>

<p>‘You must remember, sir,’ said Danevitch severely, ‘I
have been instructed to try and unravel the mystery surrounding
your late partner’s death——’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t think you are going the right way to work,’
interrupted Tauchnitz.</p>

<p>‘That is a matter of opinion,’ was the quiet rejoinder.
‘But be good enough to tell me if Mr. Ferguson kept any
private papers in his office?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>‘Oh yes; I believe he did.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! That is a point gained.’</p>

<p>‘He had a large tin box,’ proceeded Tauchnitz, in explanation,
‘in his own room, in which he kept documents
which did not relate to the business.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t know what was in that box, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘I haven’t the remotest idea.’</p>

<p>‘Could I have access to the box, do you think?’</p>

<p>‘No; I am sure you could not. I have sent it away to
his family.’</p>

<p>The opinion expressed by Mr. Tauchnitz of his partner’s
probity and honour was but a reflex of that which was
held throughout the town—indeed, it is not too much to
say throughout the greater part of Russia; for Ferguson
belonged to that class of men who understand the art of
getting themselves talked about. He had been wonderfully
successful as a merchant, and his name was associated
with so many public acts, and he had shown so much public
spirit, so much enterprise, and had advocated so many
measures calculated to benefit the working classes, that he
had come to be regarded as a benefactor, a philanthropist.</p>

<p>It is interesting to dwell upon these points, because the
sequel will be in the nature of a surprise. Danevitch’s next
step was to seek an interview with Donald, Mr. Ferguson’s
eldest son, who was also a partner in the business—as, in
fact, all the sons were. Danevitch displayed great caution
in dealing with Donald. His experience with Tauchnitz
impressed him with the necessity of exercising all the
diplomacy he was capable of exercising. Donald was
much distressed by his father’s sad end, and expressed a
desire that no stone should be left unturned to bring his
murderer to justice; but he evidently inherited his father’s
reticence, and displayed in a very marked manner the Scotch
characteristic of so-called caution.</p>

<p>‘Can you make any suggestion as to the motive for the
murder?’ asked Danevitch.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t for me to do that,’ was the answer.</p>

<p>‘We know that it wasn’t robbery,’ Danevitch said.</p>

<p>‘I’m not so sure about that.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>‘But nothing is missing.’</p>

<p>‘As far as we know at present, nothing is.’</p>

<p>‘Then, do you think something may have been stolen?’</p>

<p>‘I won’t express an opinion one way or the other.’</p>

<p>‘Still, as far as one can judge, nothing was carried off.’</p>

<p>‘So far as we can judge, that is so,’ answered Donald;
‘but the ways of thieves are incomprehensible.’</p>

<p>‘Then, you think that the man who strangled your father
was also a common thief?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot say he was, and I cannot say he wasn’t. We
have the broad fact before us that my father was murdered.
It is for you to try and find out why he was murdered.’</p>

<p>‘I understand, Mr. Donald, that your father kept a box
of private papers in his office.’</p>

<p>‘He did.’</p>

<p>‘Where is that box now?’</p>

<p>‘We have it here.’</p>

<p>‘Would you allow me to examine the papers?’</p>

<p>‘Why?’ asked Donald, evincing some surprise.</p>

<p>‘Because it is possible—I only say it is possible—that I
might find something amongst them that will help me in
my inquiry.’</p>

<p>Something like an ironical smile flitted across Donald’s
face as he said:</p>

<p>‘I don’t think that is at all likely.’</p>

<p>‘And yet, in the interest of all concerned, I should like
to put it to the test. May I do so?’</p>

<p>‘You may,’ answered Donald, after a pause, ‘if my
mother and brother have no objections to your taking
that course.’</p>

<p>The mother and brother being consulted, they gave
their consent, subject to the two sons being present at
the time of the examination. That being agreed to, the
box was brought forth and opened. It was not unlike
the tin boxes seen in lawyers’ offices, but it was furnished
with a peculiar and unusually strong lock, and as the key
to fit it could not be found, the services of a blacksmith
were secured, and after a great deal of trouble he got the
lid open. The very first thing that Danevitch’s eye fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
upon was a packet, tied round with red tape, and marked
in the corner very legibly, ‘In the event of my death burn
this packet unopened.’</p>

<p>By an adroit movement he seized that packet unseen by
the others and slipped it into his pocket. He had a feeling
that it contained the solution of the mystery, and he
considered that, in the interests of justice, he was perfectly
entitled to appropriate it and examine it.</p>

<p>It was the law of Russia, at any rate, that any papers or
documents, however private, could be seized if justice was
to be aided thereby. If he was mistaken in his surmise,
then he would certainly carry out the dead man’s request
and burn the packet, and any secrets it might reveal to
him would never be breathed to a living soul, and the packet
once burnt, no one would be any wiser. The other papers
in the box were looked through, but there was nothing
found that could be of any use—nothing of a compromising
character, and the sons seemed gratified and pleased.</p>

<p>An hour or two later, locked in his room at the hotel
where he was staying, Danevitch opened the packet, and
its contents revealed to him in a very short time an astounding
story, and put him on the track of the murderer.</p>

<p>He found, as he had all along suspected, that Donald
Ferguson, the upright merchant, the man of unimpeachable
honour, the philanthropist, the public-spirited citizen,
the defender of the weak, the faithful husband, the good
father, had been very human, very weak. From the particulars
furnished by the secret packet of papers, Danevitch
gradually learnt the following story.</p>

<p>A woman named Blok had come some years before
Ferguson’s murder to reside in Riga. She had spent the
greater part of her life in a small town in the far interior
of Russia. Her husband had followed the occupation of
a boatman on the Volga, being assisted by his two sons,
Alex and Peter. He had two daughters, Catherine and
Anna. The Blok family were held in high estimation by
all who knew them. Although occupying but a comparatively
humble position in the social scale, they were
eminently respectable, and were regarded as hard-working,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
honest people. Of course, they were very poor, and were
not able to make much, if any, provision for old age or
accident. One day Blok and his son Alex were drowned.
A steamer laden with convicts on their way to Siberia ran
their boat down during a dense fog. At certain seasons
of the year fogs are very prevalent on the Volga River.
The breadwinner of the family being thus suddenly taken
away, the Bloks found themselves without means of support.
The youngest son, Peter, was then but eighteen,
and unable to earn more than would suffice for his own
wants. Under these circumstances, and acting on the
advice of a married sister, who resided in Riga with her
husband, who was a shipwright, Mrs. Blok removed to
Riga with her two daughters, hoping that in the busy
seaport they would all be able to find some employment.</p>

<p>Catherine, the younger of the two girls, was noted for
her good looks. They were both pretty girls, in fact, but
Catherine was exceptionally attractive. Moreover, she was
bright, intelligent, and in a certain way clever. They
had not been in Riga very long before they both obtained
work in the firm of Ferguson, Tauchnitz, and Co. It
appears that they very soon attracted the notice of Mr.
Ferguson, who displayed great interest in them and improved
their position very much. Six months later Anna
fell seriously ill through blood-poisoning, caused by pricking
her finger at the warehouse, and, in spite of the best
medical advice provided for her by Mr. Ferguson, she died.</p>

<p>It was well known that Mr. Ferguson showed the greatest
kindness to the family during their trouble, and all the
expenses of the funeral were defrayed by him. Peter Blok,
the only surviving son, came to Riga at this time to attend
his sister’s funeral, and it seemed that Mr. Ferguson took
a fancy to him, and gave him employment in the warehouse,
where he remained for about three months. At
the end of that time he was sent on board a vessel belonging
to the firm, and made several voyages, and finally he
was placed in command of a river-boat employed in the
Astrakhan trade.</p>

<p>About two years after Anna’s death the Blok family, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the surprise of everyone, suddenly left Riga. The reason
of their going, and the place where they were going to,
were alike kept secret. For a few weeks before they went,
Catherine remained at home on the plea of ill-health.
She did not seem ill, and nobody thought she was ill,
consequently the astonishment of her companions was
great, as may be imagined. It would appear that Catherine
Blok was a somewhat remarkable girl in this way. She
was exceptionally good-looking. She was far above the
average peasant in intelligence. Had the opportunity
been afforded, her intellectual powers would probably have
enabled her to take a superior position in life—that is to
say, superior to vast numbers of people occupying the
same plane as herself. What is meant by this will be
better understood if it is borne in mind that, as a rule,
the Russian peasantry are more ignorant and more stupid,
probably, than any other peasantry in the world. There
are two main causes for this. The primary one is climatic;
the secondary the powerful influence of the Church. The
climatic conditions are a very long and terribly severe
winter, which for a period ranging from seven to eight
months prevents the peasant from labouring out of doors;
in consequence of this he is reduced to much the same
condition as hibernating animals. His winter life, in
fact, is one of enforced indolence and inactivity. His
house is insanitary, comfortless, and more or less filthy.
His whole surroundings are calculated to debase and
brutalize him. He has no intellectual enjoyments because
he has no intellectual yearnings. He is content to live as
his father and grandfather before him lived. What was
good enough for them is good enough for him, he says. As
regards the influence of his Church, that makes itself felt
from his earliest years. He is taught to believe that he
has no right to reason or question. Everything must be
accepted in blind, implicit faith. Such education as he
receives is of the most elementary character; and having
inherited from his forefathers dulness of perception and a
lethargic temperament, he does not concern himself about
anything beyond gratifying his animal wants.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Of course, there are exceptions to all this. Among the
teeming millions of Russia this must obviously be the case.
The Blok family were a very notable example indeed, and
Catherine was the head of them.</p>

<p>It presents a most interesting study in psychology—though
it cannot be touched upon here except in a passing
way—that Ferguson, the rich merchant, the broad-minded
citizen, the respected husband and affectionate father,
should have been irresistibly attracted to Catherine Blok,
the very humble-born and ignorant peasant. Yet so it
was, and when Catherine left Riga, she was influenced
thereto by Ferguson, and her object in going was to
conceal, as far as could be concealed, the fact that the
merchant prince and the peasant girl had met on a
common ground; and as is invariably the result under
such circumstances, and in such a case, the meeting was
fraught with terrible consequences to both of them.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Blok and Catherine left Riga, they retired
to Valdai, in the Valdai Hills, in the province of Novgorod,
to the south of St. Petersburg. Valdai was a very quiet,
out-of-the-way place. Here the mother and daughter
took up their quarters in a stone-built house, and enjoyed
comfort, convenience, and luxury, which must have been
very novel to them. They knew no one, and were utterly
unknown; nor did they seek to be known or to know.
At regular intervals, about once a month, a man visited
them. He was in the habit of going to St. Petersburg.
There he posted to Valdai, a distance of nearly a hundred
miles. He could have gone quite close to the place by
train, but he preferred the round-about way for reasons of
his own. He invariably arrived at Valdai at night, and
when he left he always went away early in the morning.</p>

<p>This sort of thing went on for something like three
years. Then the visits of the man ceased, but correspondence
passed between him and Catherine, who was the
mother of a son about two and a half years old. The
man had looked after her and her offspring, but not as
liberally as he might and ought to have done. At last
differences arose between them. These differences were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
traceable to Mrs. Blok. She thought, probably not without
some justification, that her daughter had not been
treated well. In the end the man exacted from Catherine
a document, which was signed by herself and counter-signed
by her mother. In this document, which was very
artfully drawn up, and was not, it is needless to say,
Catherine’s composition, the man was represented as
having been the victim of extortion and blackmailing, and
the girl stated that it was impossible for her to fix the
parentage of her son. It need hardly be said that the
man who was in the habit of visiting Catherine at Valdai,
and who took such extraordinary precautions to prevent his
visits being known to anyone else, was Donald Ferguson,
the merchant of Riga.</p>

<p>By means of the papers found in the packet which he
took from Ferguson’s private box, aided and supplemented
by many and patient inquiries, Danevitch was enabled to
work out the foregoing pitiable little story. During the
time he was so engaged—it extended over several weeks—there
was an outcry against him. He was expected to do
so much; and those who ought to have known better
thought he was doing so little. Of course the general
public did not know that he was engaged in the business
at all, and, with the pig-headedness and stupidity peculiar
to a mob, they railed against the authorities, saying it was
shameful that so popular, upright, and true a man as Mr.
Ferguson should be strangled to death in a place considered
to be so well policed and watched as Riga; and yet all the
vigilance and all the cleverness of the police were powerless
alike to stay the crime and to bring the criminal to justice
when the crime had been committed.</p>

<p>‘Our lives and property are not safe,’ exclaimed the
rabble. ‘The police are supine; they are useless; they
are in league with the knaves who prey upon honest
citizens. If this is not so, how is it they have not brought
Mr. Ferguson’s murderer to book?’</p>

<p>This was the tone adopted by a low Radical anti-Government
paper, which styled itself the organ and the
mouthpiece of the people. Although as a rule it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
opposed to the moneyed and privileged classes, it was
pleased in this instance—because it gave it a <i>raison d’être</i>
for hurling abuse at the heads of the authorities—to place
Mr. Ferguson upon a pinnacle of greatness, and to speak
of him almost as if he were a martyred saint. The rulers
in Russia are peculiarly sensitive to, and intolerant of,
criticism, and the authorities in Riga, stung by the lashings
of the local organ, lunged out, so to speak, and
grabbed the first person they could lay their hands on.
The Russian police have a habit of doing this when driven
to desperation.</p>

<p>In the Riga case the arrests were made so indiscriminately
and fatuously that the unfortunate suspects, after
enduring much misery and indignity, were set at liberty
with a growl that was not unlike a curse, and the local
paper hurled more thunderbolts at the heads of the police,
and showed a disposition to canonize the murdered man at
the expense of the authorities. During all the time that
this agitation was going on, Danevitch was working slowly
but surely at his task of drawing aside the curtain and
revealing the mystery. But those in authority above him,
in spite of his record, considered that he was fumbling in
the dark, and looking for clues in impossible places. But
having learnt something about Mr. Ferguson’s skeleton
from that packet of private papers, which was to be
destroyed unopened in the event of Mr. Ferguson’s death,
he proceeded on his own lines. It would not be easy to
give a reason that would satisfy all minds why Mr.
Ferguson kept those incriminating documents; but no
doubt he thought that as long as he lived the confession—if
it could be so called—which he had exacted from
Catherine Blok would effectually protect him against any
further claims she might be inclined to make against him;
because he could confront her with that document, and say,
‘Look here, you acknowledge certain things. Here is your
confession in black and white signed with your name.
Therefore, if you don’t leave me alone I will charge you
with blackmailing me.’</p>

<p>This, of course, was the weapon of a cunning and artful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
man which he used to menace and subdue the ignorant,
the weak and wronged woman. He knew well enough in
his own mind that he dare not make that document public;
for though part of the girl’s statement might be believed,
he would not come off scot-free, for would not people say,
‘If you had nothing to fear, why did you get that confession
from her?’</p>

<p>The first step which Danevitch took after reading the
contents of the sealed packet was to learn something of
the Blok family; and to that end, in the character of an
old vagrant man, he visited the mother and the daughter
in their retreat at Valdai. It took him some time to
gather the materials for the little family history already
narrated. Necessarily, before he could do that, he had to
worm himself into their confidence, and he would not have
succeeded in doing that had he not laid a pretended claim
to occult powers, which enabled him to read the past and
divine the future. With such people as the Bloks this
went a long way. They, in common with their class, had
a fixed belief in charms, fortune-telling and spells.</p>

<p>When Danevitch saw the infant son of Catherine, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘Ah, that is a fine child! but alas for his future!’</p>

<p>‘How so? What mean you?’ asked the young mother
in alarm.</p>

<p>‘The child that knows not his father is ill-starred.’</p>

<p>‘Knows not his father!’ echoed Catherine, with flashing
eyes, and a voice tremulous with indignation. ‘How dare
you say that?’ she added menacingly, as she stamped her
foot.</p>

<p>‘Think you,’ asked the pseudo-seer, ‘that I can be
deceived? I see with eyes different to yours. That child
knows not his father, and never will know him, for he is
dead.’</p>

<p>Here Catherine burst into tears, and between her sobs
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘It’s true, it’s true, it’s true!’</p>

<p>‘Of course it is,’ said Danevitch, with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>Catherine recovered herself, and in an irascible tone said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>‘No doubt you are very clever; but I doubt if you can
tell me how his father died.’</p>

<p>Danevitch closed his eyes for some moments, and drew
his hand down his face like one deeply immersed in thought.
Then, suddenly starting up, he answered solemnly:</p>

<p>‘He was done to death foully. He was strangled.’</p>

<p>Catherine was terribly distressed, and, sinking into a
chair, she covered her face with her hands and wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blok, who was present, was indignant, and said
angrily to Danevitch:</p>

<p>‘Get you out of the house. You distress my daughter.
She is an honest woman, and we do not want to hear anything
more from you.’</p>

<p>‘Be not angry, good mother,’ said Danevitch. ‘Your
daughter questioned, and I answered.’ Then, with sudden
and startling abruptness, he asked, ‘Where is your son?’</p>

<p>The mother’s face grew pale, and, with evident distress
and emotion, she said:</p>

<p>‘He is dead.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, one is; he moulders at the bottom of the Volga;
but the living one, the living one, where is he?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Blok looked appalled, and drew back from this
strange old man from whom nothing seemed hidden, and
before she could answer, Catherine started up, passionate
and flushed, and cried excitedly:</p>

<p>‘Leave us, leave us! in the name of the Great Father,
go! My brother is far away; hundreds of versts of sea
divide him from his native land, and mayhap he will come
back no more.’</p>

<p>‘It were well for him if he stayed away,’ remarked
Danevitch with solemnity. ‘But why grow angry with
me, my child? I have sorrow for you; I have tears for
you. You have been ensnared, deluded, cheated; and he
who ensnared you and cheated you stood high in the
estimation of men. The penalty of his folly was his life.
He has paid it. For your weakness blood lies at your door,
and nothing can ever wash it away.’</p>

<p>At these words Catherine uttered a smothered cry, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
fell into her mother’s arms, and Mrs. Blok, excited and
enraged, screamed at him:</p>

<p>‘Out of the house, I tell you, out of the house! You
lay murder to our charge, and you lie. Go away! I
command you in God’s name to go.’ She crossed herself
as she spoke, and with her finger drew an imaginary
cross between herself and the prophet of evil, murmuring
as she did so: ‘We are defenceless women; God
shield us!’</p>

<p>The painful and dramatic scene affected Danevitch, and
he silently withdrew; but he felt that he had got confirmation
of his surmises, for as soon as he learnt the story
of the family, he came to the conclusion in his own mind
that the man who had deprived Ferguson of his life was
Catherine’s unhappy brother. The young fellow, proud-spirited
and honest, flamed up at his sister’s wrong, and,
taking the matter in his own hands, had penned that letter
to Ferguson demanding an interview. It was obvious
there had been other letters written, because the writer
said, ‘This is the last chance I shall give you.’ Who
could have written that letter—which Danevitch so
patiently pieced together from the shreds picked out of
the waste-paper basket—if it had not been the broken-hearted
brother? He knew Ferguson, he had been
employed in the warehouse; and the great wrong his sister
had suffered made him desperate—made him forget the
social division which separated him from his sister’s wronger.
He went to him, not with robbery in his heart—he was
too proud for that—not with murder in his heart, but to
demand that the false statement which had been wrung
from poor Catherine should be given up to him, and that
Ferguson should recognise the claims the girl and the child
had upon him.</p>

<p>It was easy to work out the sequel. Peter went to the
office; he wanted the paper his sister had signed. He
probably grew angry, and threatened his employer. The
employer was obstinate, stubborn, perhaps insulting, until,
stung into frenzy, the unhappy youth flew at him, and,
blinded by his passion, Peter had crushed the life out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the man before he knew it. Youthful strength and fury
made Peter Blok a murderer, although he may have had
no wish to slay his victim. Finding, to his dismay, that
death had silenced for ever the lips of his sister’s betrayer,
he made a frantic effort to discover the paper which he
knew was in Ferguson’s possession. But his search proving
fruitless, he fled with remorse, no doubt, gnawing at his
heart.</p>

<p>Danevitch says that never throughout his career did he
start to hunt down a man with greater reluctance than he
did in the case of Peter Blok. With the exception of
Danevitch himself, no one suspected Peter, and as it had
taken him some weeks to learn what he had learnt, the
young fellow had got a start which would probably save
him from the law’s vengeance.</p>

<p>Danevitch, proceeding with great caution and tact, found
out that Peter had been second in command of a river-boat
engaged in bringing furs down from Astrakhan. The boat
was one of the river fleet belonging to Ferguson, Tauchnitz,
and Co. Three weeks before the crime in Riga, Peter
obtained leave of absence in order to visit his mother, who
was sick. As it was a long journey to where his mother
was living, his lengthened absence did not arouse any
suspicion. After the commission of the crime, there was
every reason to believe he quitted Riga at once, and
Danevitch satisfied himself that Peter had not gone to
Valdai again. As he had already spent several days there
with his mother and sister, had he returned he must have
been noticed, for it was a small place, and a stranger was
spotted immediately.</p>

<p>From what Danevitch had gathered during his interview,
in the character of a gipsy, with Catherine and her mother,
he inferred that Catherine, at any rate, if not Mrs. Blok,
knew that Peter was going to see Ferguson. And from
what Catherine said during the interview—‘My brother is
far away; hundreds of versts of sea divide him from his
native land, and maybe he will come back no more’—the
deduction was Peter had gone to sea. Being a sailor, he
would probably experience no difficulty in obtaining a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
ship. And it was equally feasible to suppose that before
going he wrote to his sister, telling her he was going far
beyond the seas.</p>

<p>The most diligent and careful inquiries in Riga failed to
elicit any sign that Peter had sailed from that port, and
it was likely enough that he had made his way to some
other port on the Baltic Sea, or else to Cronstadt. Anyway,
he could not be found; and as Danevitch could not
entertain a doubt that Peter had killed Ferguson, he felt
bound, as a matter of duty, to circulate a description of
him. This description, however, was not made public, but
placed in the hands of the police and their thousand and
one spies. A whole year passed, however, and no trace of
Peter was obtained. The crime had died out of the public
memory, though not out of that of the police. They have
long memories, and thus it came to pass that one day
it was announced that the supposed murderer of Donald
Ferguson, the merchant of Riga, had been arrested in
St. Petersburg. Although he had grown a beard and
whiskers, he was soon identified as Peter Blok, and a ship’s
discharge upon him showed that he had come from New
York to Cronstadt in an American ship.</p>

<p>Up to this point Danevitch had kept his knowledge of
Ferguson’s wrong-doing to himself, but now that Peter
Blok was under lock and key he was bound to make the
matter public. To the people of Riga it was like a bombshell
suddenly dropped in their midst. Everywhere where
Ferguson’s name was known, it was a shock. At first
doubts were thrown upon it; then there were open and
loud expressions of disbelief; but the damning documents
were produced, and could not be gainsaid. Then many
sympathizers with Peter came forward when the reaction
set in, and he was provided with funds for his defence;
and, of course, at the trial the whole miserable story was
pitilessly unfolded, until everyone knew it. It was a bitter,
terrible blow to the Ferguson family. It redounds to
their credit, however, that they unostentatiously made the
most ample provision for Catherine and her mother, and
the boy was provided for in such a way that it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
likely he would ever want, and it was stated that he was
to be well educated and well brought up.</p>

<p>The trial of young Blok clearly proved that nearly all
Danevitch’s surmises and deductions were correct. The lad
had heard through his mother of his sister’s wrong, and
from his sister herself he learnt how Ferguson, in order to
save himself, had wrung from the unhappy girl that false
confession, which, when she signed, she knew very little
about. It was not until later that she realized how she
had belied herself. Naturally that incensed her, and her
brother—smarting with shame and broken pride—placed
himself in communication with Ferguson, who at first tried
to ignore him, until at last, threatened with exposure, he
granted that interview which proved fatal to him.</p>

<p>When the story was all told, a revulsion of feeling in
the prisoner’s favour took place, and he received the mild
sentence of seven years’ banishment in Siberia.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE GREAT CONSPIRACY.</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Count Obolensk</span> had resided in London for a good many
years. He occupied a magnificent house in the neighbourhood
of Hyde Park, where he lived in almost regal style.
He kept a retinue of servants. The furnishings and appointments
of his princely abode were said to be unique;
and he dispensed hospitality with a lavish hand. He was
known to be wealthy, to be a member of a very old and
influential Russian family, and at one time to have held a
high political position in his own country. Here the
general knowledge of his affairs ended; but there were
vague and ill-defined impressions in the public mind that
he had been expelled or had fled from Russia owing to
some of those political causes which in Russia count for so
much, but which in most other countries, or at any rate
in England, would be treated with contempt. But whatever
the reasons were which had induced the Count to take
up his residence in London, those who enjoyed his acquaintance
and hospitality did not allow themselves to be
troubled by them. In his own country he might have
been regarded as little short of Satanic in his iniquity for
aught that the throngs of people who attended his receptions,
his at-homes and parties, knew or cared. The
majority of mankind, in its concrete selfishness and gluttony,
thinks little and cares less about the personal qualities of
those who minister to its sensuous gratifications; what
most concerns it is the quality and nature of the giver’s
gifts. Let these be liberal and lavish, and nothing more
is asked. In Count Obolensk’s case it was universally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
admitted that he excelled as a host, that his benevolence
knew no bounds, and he dispensed charity with a cosmopolitan
open-handedness which was worthy of all praise.
Personally he was a handsome man, with the tact and refinement
of a courtier, and the delicacy and deference of a
true-bred gentleman. He was a widower, with two grown-up
daughters—Catherine and Nathalia—both handsome
young women; while at the head of his household, as
general manageress, was an English lady, known as Mrs.
Sherard Wilson, who, it was generally understood, had
lived in Russia for a good many years. She was a fine-looking
woman, of commanding presence and strong
personality. She invariably presided at the Count’s social
functions, and acted as chaperon to his daughters. Of
her history no one knew anything, and nobody seemed concerned
about it. She was a power in the Count’s household;
and while she proved herself to be a woman of
exceeding great tact, and one who had made the art of
finesse a study, there was a tacit understanding that anyone
who offended her ever so slightly could never hope to enjoy
again the hospitality of the house over which she presided.
Her general characteristics could be summed up thus: she
was clever beyond the ordinary, well educated, a good
linguist, a tasteful and excellent hostess; she was well informed,
had more than a passing taste for politics, and
appeared to have been acquainted with many of the leading
statesmen of her time. Of them she would talk freely;
about herself she was silent, and he would have been a
bold man indeed who would have made the attempt to
‘draw her out’; he would most certainly have come to
grief. She was frequently absent from London; sometimes
for a few days, at others for weeks. But where she went
to, why she went, and what she did, were mysteries, and
the eye of vulgar curiosity was unable to penetrate them.
One thing was noted as peculiar: the Count’s daughters
never accompanied her.</p>

<p>One night at the end of January, a night that, according
to Russian reckoning, was New Year’s Eve, and usually
celebrated with great ceremony in Russia, there was a reception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
at the Count’s house. It was one of the few
occasions when every nationality save Russian was excluded.
It had been one of those trying and maddening days,
peculiar to the English climate in January. A leaden sky,
a choking, foggy atmosphere, a general gloominess, and a
sense of that awful depression which seems to justify all the
hard things said about our climate by foreigners.</p>

<p>However, the weather notwithstanding, there was a large
gathering at the Count’s house. Russians had come from
France, from Germany, from Switzerland, in order to be
present, and they made up a brilliant assembly. According
to Russian custom, there was a religious ceremony first of all.
Then followed a sumptuous repast, which included almost
every known Russian dish. After that the Count and his
guests retired to a large, heavily-curtained room, which,
compared with other apartments in the house, was plainly
furnished. It was lighted by three long windows on the
east side, but each of these windows was screened by
massive velvet curtains, which completely shut out the fog
and the gloom, while a very handsome twelve-light gaselier,
with tinted, rose-coloured shades, diffused a soft and agreeable
light throughout the apartment. The floor was
covered with an unusually thick carpet laid on very stout
felt. Not only was this most comfortable to the feet, but
it deadened sound, and the footfalls of the heaviest person
walking across the room could not be heard. At one end
of the room was a deep angle or recess, and placed diagonally
in this recess was a large carved oak bureau or
writing-desk. The entrance to the chamber was by a
panelled doorway, closed by an ordinary door, masked by
a second door lined with thick red felt or baize. This excluded
draught as well as sound. And assuming that
anyone had been prompted by curiosity or other cause to
play eavesdropper, he would have needed an abnormally
acute sense of hearing to have gathered any of the conversation
carried on in the room. At the opposite end of
the apartment—which was oblong—was another door,
giving access to a small anteroom, the walls of which were
lined with shelves filled with books.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>On the evening in question, when the Count and his
guests retired to the large chamber described, they made it
evident that they wished to be free from any possibility of
interruption, for the baize-covered door was locked inside,
and so was its companion door. The curtains at the
windows were so closely drawn that human eye could not
by any possible means have discerned from the outside
what was going on in the inside.</p>

<p>In this room the Count and his visitors remained for
over two hours. They talked much, but not loudly nor
excitedly. Nearly everyone smoked, until the atmosphere
became heavy and thick, in spite of a large ventilator in
the ceiling. But nobody seemed to mind the heat or the
fœtidness. Every man appeared to be very earnest and
absorbed with what was going on, and when he rolled a
new cigarette, he generally did it in a preoccupied and
automatic sort of way. Occasionally the host, who sat at
the large desk in the recess, made notes, and read them out
to the company. Sometimes what had been written was
approved of; at others dissent was expressed, and discussion
ensued. Then the writing would either be altered or
allowed to remain as first written, according to the wishes
of the majority.</p>

<p>It was two o’clock in the morning when the meeting
broke up. Then the Count carefully locked his desk, and
placed the keys in his pocket. He unlocked the doors,
and led his guests to the spacious dining-room, where light
refreshments were provided. A quarter of an hour or
twenty minutes later a man very cautiously rose up in the
recess in the room where the meeting had been held, and
where he had been concealed behind the bureau or writing-desk,
and, stretching his cramped limbs, he got out, crept
towards the door, listened intently, and, having assured himself
that the coast was clear, hurried out. At three o’clock
such of the guests as were not staying in the house began
to take their departure, a few in broughams, the majority
in cabs, which had been waiting through the bitter night.</p>

<p>As most people know, the Russian New Year time is
kept up with great festivity; and, hospitable though he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
was at all times, the Count, if possible, excelled himself on
this occasion, and those who were privileged to be present
went away with a feeling that they might have travelled
the wide world over without meeting with such princely
entertainment so delicately and gracefully dispensed. Host,
hostess, and the host’s daughters were always voted perfect,
and very lavish praise was uttered when Mrs. Sherard Wilson
was referred to, the English people particularly, who had
the <i>entrée</i> to the Count’s rooms during the festive gatherings,
expressing their admiration in no measured terms.</p>

<p>At last the series of New Year receptions and entertainments
came to an end, and there was a lull, which was
taken advantage of by the Misses Obolensk to make their
arrangements for a forthcoming ball, which they intended
to give on a grand scale. The organizing of this ball was
left entirely to the young ladies, as Mrs. Sherard Wilson
was on the eve of departure on a journey to the Continent.
The Count never concerned himself about his domestic or
social arrangements; he left everything to the ladies. He
was a great reader, and he wrote a good deal. Such exercise
as he took he got either in his carriage or on horseback.
He did not visit much, but was passionately fond of music,
and went to all the principal concerts, and occasionally
attended the theatres. His was a routine life; he was
very regular in his habits, and one day was much like
another with him. His position in every way seemed an
enviable one, and apparently he lived in amity with all
men. All those who knew him respected and honoured
him.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the gathering of Russians at his
house to celebrate the New Year’s Eve, Miss Nathalia
Obolensk was descending the main stairway in a white
satin evening dress, with a magnificent red camellia in her
hair, for she was going to a grand concert with her father,
and the carriage was waiting at the door. Coming after
her was a liveried man-servant bearing a large tray full of
tea-things, including a kettle of hot water, a silver teapot
with the remains of the tea in it, a large jug of cream, and
other things, that he had just brought from the drawing-room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
He was a stolid, stupid-looking man, and suddenly
he justified his looks by stumbling and scattering the
contents of the tray over the young lady, tea, hot water,
jelly, being poured over her splendid dress, to its ruin. She
uttered a shrill cry of alarm, which quickly brought her
father, Mrs. Wilson, and some of the other servants into
the hall, and a very dramatic scene ensued. The shock to
her nerves, and the realization that the mishap had not
only spoilt her pretty frock, but would prevent her going
to the concert, had such an effect upon Nathalia that she
flew down the few remaining stairs, flung her arms about
her father’s neck, and fainted.</p>

<p>In the meantime the author of the mischief presented a
very sorry spectacle. He seemed thoroughly ashamed of
himself, and undecided whether to bolt at once or gather up
the wreckage. Nor was his confusion and distress lessened
by the torrent of abuse and passionate scolding which fell
from Mrs. Sherard Wilson’s lips. In the choicest of
Russian she told him he was a ‘dolt,’ an ‘idiot,’ a ‘fool,’
a ‘brute beast.’</p>

<p>‘Leave the things, you stupid!’ she exclaimed fierily.
‘Ever since you entered the house, you have done nothing
but make mistakes and smash things up. But it’s the last
chance you’ll have of doing mischief here. In ten minutes
you’ll be out. Do you mark what I say? Ten minutes
only, and if you are not out of the house, then the other
servants shall kick you out.’</p>

<p>‘If you please, my lady,’ whined the man, ‘I am entitled
to a month’s notice or a month’s wages.’</p>

<p>‘You will get neither, you blockhead!’ replied the lady.
‘Why, your month’s wages won’t pay for the things you’ve
broken. And what business had you coming down the
main staircase. It was your place to use the servants’
staircase.’</p>

<p>‘I’m very sorry,’ moaned Andrey, ‘and beg your
pardon——’</p>

<p>‘Sorry, you wretch! well you may be!’ exclaimed the
irate lady, unappeased by the culprit’s penitence; ‘but get
out of my sight, and in ten minutes you must have left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the house. Paul’—this to the head-butler—‘Paul, I
charge you to see the fellow is off the premises in ten
minutes.’</p>

<p>With this peremptory command, she hastened to the
reception-room, whither the Count had had his daughter
conveyed. He was much annoyed, but did not allow his
annoyance to find expression, as Mrs. Wilson did.</p>

<p>Nathalia had by this time recovered from her faint, and
was bewailing her woe-begone condition, and the blighted
prospects of an evening’s enjoyment. Her father was
urging her to go upstairs and change her dress, saying
that they could still be in time for the concert, but she
said it was impossible; she was too much upset, and had
neither energy nor inclination to perform her toilet over
again, notwithstanding that she had two maids to wait
upon her. Finding that she was inflexible on this point,
her father expressed a hope that she would soon regain her
composure, and that he would see her at supper-time, and
leaving her to the care of Mrs. Wilson, he retired to his
study. In a little more than ten minutes the butler came
to Mrs. Wilson and announced that Andrey had gone.</p>

<p>‘Thank goodness!’ exclaimed the lady. ‘I am sure I
never had such a stupid person in my service before.
Whatever were you doing to engage such a dolt?’</p>

<p>‘He came to me very well recommended, madame.’</p>

<p>‘Then, those who recommended him ought to be ashamed
of themselves; that’s all that I’ve got to say. It’s really
shameful that people who call themselves honest should
recommend incompetent servants in order to get them off
their hands.’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid it’s frequently done, madame,’ the butler
remarked.</p>

<p>‘That is no excuse.’</p>

<p>‘I do not offer it as an excuse, madame. I agree with
you that it is shameful.’</p>

<p>‘But surely when you engaged Andrey you might have
seen that he was a fool.’</p>

<p>‘No, madame, I did not,’ answered the butler with some
show of wounded dignity. ‘He seemed sharp enough at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
first. His stupidity set in afterwards. I fancy he is a little
given to drink, though I’ve never missed anything, and have
never seen him really the worse for liquor.’</p>

<p>‘How long is it since he came here?’ demanded the lady
warmly.</p>

<p>‘Just six weeks, I think.’</p>

<p>‘That’s six weeks too long. Take good care that the
next man you engage knows his business.’ The butler
bowed and was retiring, when Mrs. Wilson called him
back. ‘Stay a minute. You are aware that I am leaving
London to-morrow, and may be absent three or four
weeks. You had better not engage anyone else until I
return.’</p>

<p>‘But, madame, we shall be short-handed, and——’</p>

<p>‘I don’t care whether you are short-handed or not.
You will do as I tell you.’</p>

<p>Paul knew that it would be fatal to his interests to
attempt to argue with his mistress when she was in a bad
temper, so he made his bow and discreetly withdrew.</p>

<p>‘Now, Nathalia,’ said Mrs. Wilson, when the man had
left them, ‘away you go upstairs, change your dress and
take your father to the concert. You know how disappointed
he will be if he doesn’t go, and as I am leaving
to-morrow, I don’t wish to see him miserable and unhappy.
You know what a sensitive man he is, and though he doesn’t
say much, he feels the more.’</p>

<p>This appeal had its effect. Nathalia’s ruffled feelings had
smoothed down.</p>

<p>‘Very well, I will go,’ she said; ‘but it’s an awful
nuisance having to change my things in a hurry.’</p>

<p>She rang for her maids, and while Mrs. Wilson gave
orders that the carriage was to be kept at the door,
Nathalia hurried to her room, reappearing in about twenty
minutes, looking, as far as personal appearance was concerned,
as if nothing had happened, though there was still
an expression of worry and concern on her handsome face.
Mrs. Wilson had already warned the Count not to settle
himself to his reading, as he would still be able to go to
the concert. He was delighted at this, for he did not like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to have his plans changed, and he was waiting in the hall
when his daughter came downstairs.</p>

<p>‘Well, my dear,’ he said to her in complimentary strains,
‘you look charming in spite of the little contretemps. It’s
an ill wind that blows nobody any good, and I suppose the
spoilt dress means a fresh order to your dressmaker, and
a further lightening of my purse.’</p>

<p>He laughed pleasantly, and, following his daughter into
the carriage, they drove off, and after all were in time to
hear the best part of the concert.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Wilson and Nathalia appeared at the
breakfast-table the next morning, they had both recovered
from the previous evening’s little annoyance. Mrs. Wilson
was somewhat hasty-tempered, but she very soon got over
her small outbursts, and her usual condition was a very
pleasant geniality. During the breakfast, Andrey’s gross
stupidity was discussed and laughed at; and when the
Count, with his usual generosity, said he thought that the
fellow’s wages should be sent to him, for, in spite of his
stupidity, it was after all an accident, the lady acquiesced,
and a little later she put up the amount in a packet, and
instructed Paul to see that Andrey got it. Then she
busied herself during the rest of the day in seeing that
everything was in ‘apple-pie order’ previous to her departure,
for whenever she was away the management of
the household devolved almost entirely upon the servants.
It was true there was an excellent housekeeper, and
Catherine was exceedingly domesticated; besides this, she
took an interest in the house. Nevertheless Mrs. Wilson
was always under the impression that her absence meant
disruption, and that it was impossible for things to flow
smoothly while she was away. It was a pleasant little bit
of conceit and did no harm, for while it gratified her it
amused the others.</p>

<p>Dinner was unusually early that evening, for Mrs. Wilson
had to catch the night mail to Dover. Her luggage—she
never travelled without a considerable quantity—had previously
been conveyed to the station, and, dinner over, she
arrayed herself in a costly and handsome Russian fur cloak,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and, in company with her maid, was driven in her brougham
to Holborn Viaduct, and a first-class compartment was
specially reserved for herself and her companion.</p>

<p>The weather was still atrocious. It was bitterly cold.
There had been a drizzling rain all day long. The mud
in the streets was of inky colour, and of glutinous consistency.
People flitted by in the foggy atmosphere like
ghosts, and not all the lights of London could relieve the
gloom and depressing atmospheric effects. There were
very few passengers that night; but amongst them was a
man of medium height, attired in a long ulster and a seal-skin
cap, the flaps of which were turned down until his
face was all but hidden. He had taken a second-class
ticket, and he and a young German, a commercial traveller,
were the only occupants of the compartment. When
Dover was reached, the rain was pouring down, the sea
roared, and Channelward all was dark as Erebus. The
man in the ulster, whose only luggage consisted of a hand-bag,
hurried on board the small steamer, which was grinding
away at the pier as the water tossed her up and down.
Ensconcing himself in the shadow of the funnel, he watched
the passengers as they descended the unsteady gangway;
and having seen Mrs. Wilson and her maid come on board
and retire to the cabin reserved for them, he dived down
into the saloon and ordered supper, for he was hungry.</p>

<p>The crossing was an exceedingly rough one. The
wretched cockleshell of a steamer which the railway company
considered good enough to carry their passengers
from one shore to the other was tossed about in a manner
well calculated to alarm any but hardened travellers. The
man in the ulster, however, was not affected. Having
enjoyed a good supper, and washed it down with a pint of
champagne, he produced from his case a very big and very
strong-looking cigar, and lighting it, he battened his seal-skin
cap down on his head and went on deck, where he
remained until the steamer glided into Calais Harbour
from the storm-tossed waters of the Channel. He remained
until Mrs. Wilson and her maid had gone on
shore. Then he followed, carrying his hand-bag. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
went into the douane, had his bag examined, saw a porter
deposit the lady’s wraps and rugs in the first-class compartment
of the carriage labelled ‘Through carriage to
Geneva,’ and, that done, placed his own bag in an adjoining
compartment, and as his second-class ticket had only
been from London to Calais, he secured a first-class for
Geneva, and was one of the very few passengers who
travelled that dark and stormy night to the French
capital of Switzerland on the shores of Lake Leman.</p>

<p>At the period of this story Alexander II. sat upon the
throne of All the Russias. It is a matter of history now
that he was one of the best-threatened monarchs who ever
ruled over a so-called civilized people. His life had been
attempted so many times that he lived in constant fear and
dread, and the most extraordinary measures were taken for
his preservation. He changed his bedroom every night;
his palace was filled with soldiers; his food was cooked by
special cooks, who were solemnly sworn in in accordance
with the rites of their Church to protect him; nevertheless,
their <i>chef</i> had to appear in the royal presence at every
meal and taste all the dishes before they were served to his
august master. But even then dozens of eyes watched
the man’s every movement, lest he might adroitly slip
poison into the food. It was a terrible penalty for an
Emperor to have to pay for his greatness, but, unhappily,
it was a condition of things that had been familiar, more
or less, to Russian rulers for a long time. Michael Danevitch
was held high in the esteem of the Czar, who regarded
him as one of his strongest safeguards. The famous
detective’s restoration to the Treasury of the stolen million
roubles was a thing of the past, and was almost forgotten;
but that exploit had made his reputation, and gave him an
absolutely independent position as well as power. Since
then he had displayed remarkable zeal and acumen. He
had unearthed numerous dastardly plots, and had sent
to the fortress of Peter and Paul, the prison of Schlusselburgh,
and to Siberia, many desperate men, who believed
that the way to freedom and reform was by the destruction
of human life and the shedding of innocent blood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>It was well known throughout Russia at this time that
a secret Nihilist organization existed of vast proportions,
and that one of the main objects of the association was to
bring about the death of the Czar. It is difficult to understand
how men and women, claiming to be intelligent and
reasoning beings, could come to believe that by slaying
their monarch they would redress their own wrongs, real
or imaginary. Everyone was aware that the moment the
breath was out of the body of one Czar, another would
step into his place. The cry of ‘Le Roi est mort!’ would
be echoed back by ‘Vive le Roi!’</p>

<p>There could be no interregnum for a single hour, unless
a tremendous social upheaval took place and a republic was
proclaimed. But while that is the easiest thing imaginable
in France, it never has been possible in Russia; firstly, on
account of the enormous extent of the country; secondly,
by reason of the varied nationalities represented; and
thirdly, owing to the want of anything like homogeneousness
among the vast masses of people swayed by the
Imperial rule. Nevertheless, to kill the Czar was the constant
aim of thousands and tens of thousands of his
subjects. It thus became necessary for his Imperial
Majesty to take the most extreme measures for the preservation
of his life. It was like a game of check and
counter-check. The Nihilists watched with a thousand
eyes; they plotted and planned with busy brains. But
they in turn were watched; and the forces of the law were
constantly at work against them. The Nihilists, however,
had the best of it. They played the cleverer game. For
in the army, the navy, in the law, the civil service, in all
classes and ranks of society, even in the Church itself, they
had their spies and agents, and those who were on the side
of the Czar found all their energies, all their vigilance,
taxed to avoid the mines which the others were ever ready
to spring. Amongst the Czar’s most devoted adherents
and trusted followers was Colonel Vlassovski, who was in
command of the military guard which night and day did
duty at the Winter Palace, where the Emperor was then
residing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>The Winter Palace of St. Petersburg is the largest
residential palace in the world, with the exception of
Versailles and the Vatican. Its length is four hundred and
fifty-five feet, and its breadth three hundred and fifty. So
spacious is its interior that as many as six thousand persons
can be easily accommodated there at one time. It will be
readily understood that to effectually guard a place of these
stupendous dimensions from a crafty, cunning, and silent
enemy, who gave no sign of his presence until he had
struck his blow, was not an easy task; and the tremendous
responsibility and ceaseless strain on the nerves which were
inseparable from Colonel Vlassovski’s position, transformed
him in a few months from a comparatively young man to
an old and haggard one. One day in the month of
December the Colonel sent an urgent message by special
courier to Danevitch, in whom he had the utmost confidence.
The message was to the effect that he wished to
see Danevitch immediately. The detective hurried at once
to the palace, and was immediately ushered into the
Colonel’s private cabinet, where there were numerous
telegraphic machines that placed the chief in communication
with all parts of the city, and nearly every part of
Russia. The Colonel temporarily dismissed his clerks and
attendants when Danevitch arrived, and bolted the door so
that they might be alone and free from interruption.</p>

<p>‘I have sent for you,’ he began, ‘to make an investigation.
Last night one of the guard in the interior of the
palace, a young soldier named Vladimir, who was on duty
near the Czar’s apartments, was surprised by the corporal
in the act of making drawings and plans of that part of
the palace. He was immediately arrested, but made the
most desperate efforts to destroy his papers. He was prevented,
however, from doing this, and an examination
proved them to be drawings to scale of certain portions
of the interior of the palace. Vladimir, before he joined
the army, was in an architect’s office. On being questioned
he grew sullen, and resolutely declined to say anything.’</p>

<p>‘And what inference do you draw from the man’s act,
Colonel?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>‘What inference! Why, can there be any doubt that
he is a Nihilist spy?’</p>

<p>‘Where is he now?’</p>

<p>‘In the fortress of Peter and Paul.’</p>

<p>‘What will be his punishment?’</p>

<p>‘As a soldier on duty he has been guilty of treason—for
it has been declared treason for any unauthorized person
to make drawings or tracings of any part of a royal
residence—he will therefore be summarily tried, and, if
proved guilty, will be instantly shot.’</p>

<p>‘And you think he will be proved guilty?’</p>

<p>‘There is not a doubt about it. He was discovered
making drawings of the palace without orders. When
questioned, he declined to give any explanation, and his
endeavours to destroy the plans showed that his motives
were not innocent ones. Of course we shall try, before he
is executed, to get information from him.’</p>

<p>‘Which you will fail to do.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because these Nihilists’ agents will not betray their
comrades.’</p>

<p>‘But he will be tortured into a confession.’</p>

<p>‘You may torture him, but he will not confess. The
Nihilists are pitiless. A traitor to their cause not only
destroys himself, but all those belonging to him, for the
vengeance falls also on his family and connections, however
innocent they may be. Vladimir knows that, and you may
depend upon it that, punish him as you will, you will never
wring from him a word of confession.’</p>

<p>‘What’s to be done, then?’ asked the Colonel, in
distress.</p>

<p>‘Let the fellow go free. Reinstate him.’</p>

<p>The Colonel stared in blank amazement; then he broke
into a mocking laugh, as he asked caustically:</p>

<p>‘Have you taken leave of your senses, Danevitch, or
become a fool?’</p>

<p>‘Neither.’</p>

<p>‘Explain, then. What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘A dead man cannot speak; a live one can. Put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
Vladimir back into his place again, and leave the rest to
me. He is a key, as it were. With him you may open
many doors. Kill him, and the doors will remain closed
against you.’</p>

<p>A new light broke on the Colonel. He looked thoughtful,
and for some moments remained silent; then he remarked:</p>

<p>‘But there are a thousand difficulties now in the way of
setting him free.’</p>

<p>‘Under ordinary circumstances, yes. But in this case a
stroke of the Czar’s pen can do it. You are in the
Emperor’s confidence. Explain to him what is required,
and in two hours’ time Vladimir can be back in the palace
again. Then he will betray himself by some act, some
sign; on the other hand, all the resources of Peter and
Paul will fail to wring from him a word that will be of use
to us.’</p>

<p>The Colonel saw the force of the argument, and said
that he would lose no time in procuring an interview with
the Czar. That was done; result, in the course of the
day Vladimir was reinstated. He had been told that on
investigation the authorities were not disposed to take a
serious view of his offence. He was a young soldier, and
of value to the State, and another chance would be given
to him. So he was severely reprimanded, and brought
back to the palace, much to his own amazement. He had
considered himself doomed, and his restoration to liberty
puzzled him; but he was too obtuse to divine the real
cause, and he did not dream how every movement of his
was being watched. Some days later he justified Danevitch’s
prediction. Being off duty, he went into the city,
and, making his way to one of the quays on the Neva, now
frozen over, he met a young woman, and was seen to hand
her a paper. They did not confer together long, and when
they separated, the young woman was followed to her home
by Danevitch. Had he been a mere subordinate of the
chief of police, he would have been compelled to have reported
this incident, with the result that a domiciliary
visit would have been paid to the house, and as a natural
corollary of that action, assuming that, as was suspected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
she was in conspiracy with others, her co-conspirators would
be warned, and justice might be defeated. Danevitch was
aware of all this, and, like a well-trained sleuth-hound, he
did not attempt to strike his quarry until he was absolutely
sure of it. He knew that at the most Vladimir could be
but a humble instrument; behind him and influencing him
were more powerful foes to the State. These were the
people he wanted to lay his hands upon. It was no use
casting his net for the little fish only; it was the big ones
he fished for. After witnessing the meeting between
Vladimir and the young woman, Danevitch had another
interview with Colonel Vlassovski, during which he informed
him that Vladimir was dangerous, and should be
closely watched, though care was to be taken not to allow
him to suspect that he was being watched. A few days
later Danevitch again went to the Colonel, and said:</p>

<p>‘I believe I am in the way of bringing to light a great
conspiracy, and I am going to leave Russia for a time.’</p>

<p>‘But how in the world can you bring the conspiracy to
light if you are out of Russia?’ asked the Colonel in alarm.
‘Your presence is required here if there is danger.’</p>

<p>‘No. I can do better elsewhere. There is danger, but
it does not threaten immediately. The head of the movement
is not in Russia. If the head is destroyed, the tail
is sure to perish. I am going to seek the head. The tail,
which is here, can be trampled on afterwards.’</p>

<p>‘Where is the head, do you think?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t exactly know. In Berlin, perhaps; in Geneva,
Paris, London.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Geneva and London!’ exclaimed the Colonel
angrily. ‘Those two places are responsible for much.
They offer refuge to the vilest of wretches so long as they
claim to be merely political offenders. Like charity, that
term covers a multitude of sins, and under its protecting
influence some of the most desperate and bloodthirsty
scoundrels who ever walked the earth have found
sanctuary.’</p>

<p>‘True,’ answered Danevitch; ‘but we cannot help that.
There are ways and means, however, of dragging rascals of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
that kind from their sanctuary. I am going to see what
can be done.’</p>

<p>‘You will keep in touch with me,’ the Colonel remarked.</p>

<p>‘Certainly I will. In the meantime, draw a closer cordon
round the palace, and let no one sleep. You must not
forget, Colonel, that the plots we are called upon to
checkmate are hatched not in Russia, but in some of the
European capitals. The poor fools who execute the work
here are mere tools. We want to lay hands on the principals,
the people who from a safe retreat supply the
money. Stop the money, and the tools will cease to
work.’</p>

<p>All that Danevitch urged was undeniable. The Colonel
knew it. Those in power knew it. The Czar himself
knew it. But hitherto the great difficulty had been to
secure the principals. The prisons were full of the hirelings;
hundreds and hundreds of them dragged out their
miserable lives in Siberia; but still the danger was not
lessened, for as long as ever money was forthcoming men
and women could always be found ready and willing to
pit their liberties and lives against the forces of the
Government. It cannot be denied that amongst them
were some, many perhaps, who were not mere hirelings,
but were prompted by mistaken notions of patriotism;
they were generally young people led away by false sentiments
and misplaced enthusiasm. It had been found, too,
that young women, for the sake of men they loved, were
willing to risk all they held sacred on earth at the bidding
of their lovers. They were the most pliant, the most
willing tools; but they were also the weak links in the
chain. They acted with less caution than men. They
went to work blindly, and with a stupid recklessness which
was bound sooner or later to betray them. Danevitch had
a favourite theory, or saying, to the effect that, given a
plot with a woman in it, all you had to do was to find out
the woman, and you would discover the plot. In this case
he had found out the woman. The one who met Vladimir
on the quay by the Neva was a book-keeper in a general
store. She shared apartments with another young woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
in a poor part of the town. At night, when her duties for
the day were over, she was in the habit of attending
secret meetings, mostly of women, with a sprinkling of
men amongst them. One of these women was a Madame
Petrarna. She was an organizer and a leader. Vladimir’s
sweetheart was in high favour with her. Petrarna was the
wife of a man who was in exile as ‘a danger to the State.’
He had been arrested as a suspicious personage, and though
nothing was actually proved against him, he was sent to
Siberia.</p>

<p>Having learnt so much about Vladimir’s sweetheart,
Danevitch devoted his attention to Petrarna. He had
made the ways of Nihilists a study, and though they had
their spies everywhere, he was often able to outwit them,
and he succeeded in getting around him a little band of
devoted agents who were ready to go anywhere and do
anything at his bidding. Amongst these agents was a
clever little woman, and she succeeded one night in gaining
admission to a meeting over which Petrarna was
presiding. The president spoke of the arrest and release
of Vladimir, and how he had been able, after all, to hand to
his sweetheart and their colleague certain drawings of the
palace, which would be invaluable to them in their work.</p>

<p>This and many other things the agent learnt, and conveyed
the intelligence to her employer Danevitch, whereby
he was induced to go abroad to search for the head, as he
had told Colonel Vlassovsky.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, and Danevitch was in Geneva. The
weather was bitter. The winter had set in very early, and
so far had been unusually severe. At this period there
were something like five thousand Russians living in
Geneva and its environs. The majority of these Russians
were Nihilists. One night, although a black <i>bise</i> was
blowing, filling the air with spiculæ of ice, and freezing
to the marrow all those who ventured into the streets,
various individuals—singly, in twos and threes—wended
their way to an old building in a lonely side-street not
far from the Gare. It was a short street, and devoted
principally to warehouses, which were closed at night;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
consequently it was badly lighted, and after business hours
practically deserted. The entrance to one of these buildings
was by an arched gateway, closed with massive wooden
gates, in one side of which was a small door to allow the
workpeople to pass in and out when the gates were closed.
On the night in question, this little door opened and shut
many times; each time it opened, somebody entered after
having been asked for a sign, a counter-sign, and a password.
Without these none could enter. At length there
were nearly fifty persons present. Then the gate was
barred and guarded. In a long back upper room, the
windows of which were so screened that not a ray of light
could escape, a meeting was held. It was a Nihilist
meeting, and the chief thing discussed was the destruction
of the Czar of Russia. Reports were also read from many
‘Centres,’ detailing the progress that was made in what was
called ‘The Revolutionary Movement.’ One man brought
with him a great quantity of seditious literature in Russian.
It had been printed by a secret press in the town. The
meeting was presided over by a lady; that lady was Mrs.
Sherard Wilson. She distributed a considerable amount
of money among those present, and talked the most
violent of language. She was a fluent and eloquent
speaker, and swayed the meeting as reeds are swayed by
the wind.</p>

<p>A long discussion followed, and many things were
settled. Amongst others, the date of the ‘Czar’s execution’
was fixed; and Mrs. Sherard announced that she
would leave for St. Petersburg in a very few days to
hasten the ‘good cause.’</p>

<p>The meeting was orderly, business-like, and quiet.
Every person present—man and woman—seemed terribly
in earnest, and there was a grim severity in their tone and
speech which argued unrelenting bitterness and hatred
against the ruler of Russia and many prominent members
of his council, all of whom were marked for swift and
sudden death. It was midnight when the meeting broke
up. Silently the people came, silently they departed; and
when the last one had gone, and the door in the gate had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
been locked, a death-like stillness reigned in the deserted
warehouse. Outside, the black <i>bise</i> roared, bringing from
the lake and the surrounding hills fierce storms of hail.</p>

<p>A little later the door of the gate opened noiselessly,
and a man, having glanced carefully up and down to see
that no one was in sight, passed out, locked the door after
him, and disappeared in the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>That man was Michael Danevitch. He had heard all
that had passed at the meeting, for he had been concealed
behind a pile of packing-cases, and his note-book was filled
with the names, so far as he could gather them, of all those
who had taken part in the proceedings.</p>

<p>Three days after the meeting had been held, Mrs. Sherard
Wilson took her departure for Berlin, where she rested
for a day and a night, and had interviews with several
influential people, and at a certain bank and money-changer’s
in Berlin she converted an English cheque for a
large amount into Russian money. She was known to the
money-changer; he had cashed similar cheques before.
Having completed her business, she pursued her way to
Russia. At the frontier her luggage and passport were
examined. There was nothing liable to duty in the former;
the latter was all in order and duly viséd. The examiners
at the frontier, however, failed to discover in one of her
trunks a very artfully and cleverly contrived false bottom,
where lay concealed not only a mass of inflammatory literature,
but documents of the most damaging description.
So she passed on her journey, distributing largess freely, and
regarded by the officials as a lady of distinction, travelling
no doubt on important business, for no one travelled for
pleasure in the winter weather. Mrs. Wilson spoke French,
German, Russian, and many dialects, so that she had no
difficulty with regard to tongues. In the same train with
her travelled a man, who was ostensibly a fur merchant, in
reality her shadower—Danevitch the detective.</p>

<p>In due course they reached St. Petersburg, and the lady
was driven to one of the principal hotels, where she
engaged a suite of rooms; and when three or four days
had elapsed, during which she was very active and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
about much, she attended a secret meeting, held in the
house of one Alexeyeff, who was a bookseller in a small
way of business. In that house over sixty persons assembled,
including the indefatigable Mrs. Sherard Wilson.
When the last person had entered, there gradually closed
around the place a cordon of heavily-armed policemen.
They, again, were reinforced by a body of soldiers with
loaded guns and fixed bayonets. At a given signal, when
all was ready, the door of the house was burst in and the
meeting, which had just got to business, was broken up in
wild confusion. The people saw that they had been
betrayed and were trapped. For a moment a panic seized
them. Some made a bid for liberty, and rushed off, but
could not get far; the cordon was too strong to be broken
through. Others, with a wild despair, prepared to sell
their lives and liberties dearly. But, as is well known,
Continental police, and particularly the Russian police,
stand on no ceremony when resistance to their authority is
offered. The maudlin sentiment which we in England so
often display, even when the most desperate ruffians are
concerned, is quite unknown abroad. Resistance to the
law generally means injury, and often death, to the resister.
On the occasion in question, the police and the soldiers were
all heavily armed, for they were aware that the work they
were called upon to perform could not be undertaken
with kid gloves on; the glittering swords and bayonets
which menaced the trapped people had an effect, and what
threatened to be a scene of bloodshed and death ended in
a despairing surrender to the forces that were irresistible.
From the moment that the police broke in upon the
meeting Mrs. Sherard Wilson felt that hope had gone, and
she made no attempt either to save her own liberty or
arouse her followers to action.</p>

<p>Under a very strong escort the misguided people were
conveyed to prison, and very soon it was made evident that
Danevitch had brought to light one of the most desperate
and gigantic conspiracies of modern times. Not only had
plans been drawn up and arrangements made for killing
the Czar, but many noblemen and high officials were to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
killed. The conspirators were chosen from all ranks of
society, and they had followers in the army and the navy, as
well as in the police. That they would have succeeded in
their nefarious designs there is little doubt, had it not been
for the vigilance and cleverness of Danevitch. He found
out that Count Obolensk, who resided in London, was
supplying large sums of money to aid the work of the
conspiracy. The detective therefore decided upon the bold
step of taking service in the Count’s household for a time.
This he succeeded in doing, and on the night of the
meeting recorded in the early part of this story, which
was held at the Count’s house, he hid himself behind the
writing-desk and heard all that took place. In order to
get away from the house without raising suspicion, he let
the tray of china fall on the stairs as Miss Obolensk was
descending. He followed Mrs. Sherard Wilson to Geneva,
and was present at that other meeting, when he gained
most important information, and subsequently, all unknown
to her, accompanied the lady to Russia.</p>

<p>Investigation brought to light the fact that Mrs. Wilson
was the wife of a Russian of high social position, but he
had been sent to Siberia for life as a political offender.
From that moment his wife became the sworn enemy of
the Government and the Czar. She had previously been
acquainted with Count Obolensk, and was able to exert
great influence over him, and, as he was very wealthy, he
proved a valuable ally. The plot failed, however, at the
eleventh hour, thanks to Danevitch. How narrow had
been the escape of the Emperor from a violent death was
revealed at the trial of the prisoners, when it was proved
that a considerable number of the officials of the palace,
as well as soldiers and servants, had been corrupted, and
on a given date a man was to be admitted to the palace at
night, and he was to throw a bomb into the Czar’s bedroom.</p>

<p>Simultaneously an attempt was to be made on the lives
of several influential people residing outside of the palace.
Desperate and terrible as all this seems, there is no doubt
it would have been attempted, for the men and women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
who were mixed up in the plot were reckless of their lives,
and terribly in earnest.</p>

<p>No mercy was shown to the prisoners, and the majority
of them were sent to some of the most inhospitable regions
of Northern Siberia, including Mrs. Sherard Wilson. To
her it must have been infinitely worse than death, and it
may be doubted if she ever survived to reach her destination.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE CROWN JEWELS.</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Moscow</span>—or, as the natives call it, Maskva—might almost
be described as a city within a city; that is to say, there
is the Kremlin, and a town outside of that again. The
word Kremlin is derived from the Slavonic word Krim,
which signifies a fort. It is built on a hill, and is surrounded
by a high turreted wall from twelve to sixteen
feet thick. This wall varies from thirty to sixty feet high,
and is furnished with battlements, embrasures, and gates.
Within the Kremlin are most of the Government offices:
the Treasury; the renowned Cathedral of St. Michael,
where the monarchs of Russia were formerly interred; and
the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, long
used as a place of coronation of the Emperors.</p>

<p>In the Treasury are preserved the State jewels, which,
in the aggregate, are probably of greater value than any
other State jewels in the civilized world. There are something
like twenty crowns of such a size, splendour, and
intrinsic value that each in itself is a fortune. Tradition
says that one of these crowns was given by the Greek
Emperor Comnenus to the great Vladimir. Some are
covered with the most magnificent diamonds; others with
turquoises of immense size; others, again, with rubies and
pearls; the groundwork of all is solid gold, and the workmanship
exquisite. Then there are sceptres of massive
gold, powdered with priceless gems. There are diamond
tiaras, diamond cinctures, services of gold and jewelled
plate, jewelled swords. These costly treasures are preserved
in a large well-lighted room of noble proportions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
and to this room the public are freely admitted. It need
scarcely be said that the State jewel-room of the Treasury
is a source of great attraction to foreigners, and no one
visiting Moscow for the first time would think of leaving
the city without having paid a visit to the Treasury jewel-room.
One morning, on opening the Museum for the day,
there was tremendous consternation amongst the officials
and attendants, when one of the guardians of the treasure-house
made the discovery that no less than three crowns,
two sceptres, a diamond belt and a diamond tiara were
missing. The circumstance was at once reported to the
keeper of the jewels—General Kuntzler. The office was
generally held by a retired military officer, and was much
sought after, as it was a life appointment and the salary
was good. The keeper had many subordinates under him,
and while they were responsible to him, he himself was
held entirely responsible by the Government for the safe-guarding
of the jewels. General Kuntzler had occupied
the position for about two years, after long and important
military service. When he heard of the robbery, he was
so affected that his mind gave way, and before the day
was out he shot himself.</p>

<p>Investigation soon made it evident that a crime of unparalleled
audacity had been committed under the very
noses of the Government officials, and property intrinsically
valued at many thousands of pounds had disappeared.
As the affair was a very serious one for all concerned, no
time was lost in summoning Michael Danevitch and enlisting
his services. As can readily be understood, quite
apart from the monetary value of the lost baubles, the
associations surrounding them made it highly desirable that
every effort should be put forth to recover them; and it was
impressed upon Danevitch how imperatively necessary it was
to take the most active measures to get on the track of
the thieves immediately, because, as everyone knew, the gold
would be melted down as soon as possible, and the precious
relics be thus destroyed. Amongst the crowns carried off
was the one worn by the last King of Poland. It was a
magnificent bauble, and was so thickly encrusted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
gems that in round figures it was worth in English money
something like fifty thousand pounds. It will be seen,
therefore, that the loss in mere value to the State was
enormous. It was, of course, as Danevitch saw clearly
enough, no ordinary robbery. It must have been planned
deliberately, and carried out with great ingenuity. Nor
was it less obvious that more than one person had been
concerned in the daring crime.</p>

<p>There was a prevailing impression at first that General
Kuntzler must have had a share in the robbery, but
Danevitch did not take that view. The unfortunate
General had an untarnished record, and though his suicide
was calculated to arouse suspicion, it was established by
Danevitch that the poor man—fully realizing the great
responsibility that rested on his shoulders—was unable to
face the blame that would attach to him. It would be
said that he had not exercised sufficient care, and had been
careless of the safety of the priceless treasures committed
to his charge. This was more than he could bear, and he
ended the whole business as far as he was concerned by
laying violent hands upon himself.</p>

<p>‘I saw from the first,’ Danevitch writes, ‘that the guilty
parties must be sought for among the ranks of those who
make robbery a fine art, if one may be allowed to so
express himself. Mere commonplace, vulgar minds would
have been incapable of conceiving, let alone of carrying
out, so daring a deed as that of robbing the State of its
priceless historical baubles. It was no less self-evident to
me that the affair must have been very carefully planned,
and arrangements made for conveying the articles out of
the country immediately, or of effectually destroying their
identity. In their original condition they would practically
be worth nothing to the illegal possessors, inasmuch
as no man dare offer them for sale; but by taking out the
gems and melting the gold the materials could thus be
converted into cash. I ascertained that when the Museum
was closed in the evening previous to the robbery being
discovered, everything was safe.’</p>

<p>It appeared that it was the duty of the chief subordinate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
one Maximoff, to go round the hall the last thing, after it
had been closed to the public for the day, and see that
everything was safe. He then reported to General
Kuntzler. This had been done with great regularity. It
so happened, however, that the day preceding the discovery
that the jewels had been stolen was an official
holiday. At stated periods in Russia there is an official
holiday, when all public Government departments are
closed. This holiday had favoured the work of the thieves,
and some time during the forty hours that elapsed between
the closing of the hall in the evening before the holiday,
and the discovery of the robbery on the morning after the
holiday, the jewels had been carried off.</p>

<p>The holiday was on a Wednesday; on Tuesday evening
Maximoff made his round of inspection as usual, and duly
presented his official report to his chief, General Kuntzler.
According to that report, everything was safe; the place
was carefully locked up, and all the keys deposited in the
custody of the General, who kept them in an iron safe in
his office. It was pretty conclusively proved that those
keys never left the safe from the time they were deposited
there on Tuesday night until Maximoff went for them
on Thursday morning. During the whole of Wednesday
Maximoff and the attendants were away. Maximoff was
a married man, with three children, and he had taken his
family into the country. Kuntzler remained, and there
was the usual military guard at the Treasury. The guard
consisted of six sentinels, who did duty night and day,
being relieved every four hours.</p>

<p>‘The whole affair was very complicated,’ proceeds Danevitch,
‘and I found myself confronted with a problem of
no ordinary difficulty. I was satisfied, however, that
General Kuntzler was entirely innocent of any complicity
in the affair; and, so far as I could determine then, there
was not the slightest ground for suspecting Maximoff.
There were twelve other subordinates. They were charged
with the duty of dusting the various glass cases in which
the jewels were deposited, and of keeping the people in
order on public days, and I set to work in my own way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
endeavour to find out what likelihood there was of any of
these men being confederates. It seemed to me that one
or more of them had been corrupted, and proved false to
his charge. Without an enemy in the camp it was difficult
to understand how the thieves had effected an entrance.’</p>

<p>The Treasury was a large white stone building, with an
inner courtyard, around which were grouped numerous
Government offices. The entrance to this yard was by a
noble archway, closed by a massive and ornamental iron
gate. In this gateway a sentry was constantly posted.
The Museum was situated in about the centre of the left
wing of the main block of buildings. The entrance was
from the courtyard, and the hall, being in an upper story,
was reached by a flight of marble steps. To gain admission
to the hall, the public were necessarily compelled
to pass under the archway, and so into the courtyard. Of
course there were other ways of reaching the hall of jewels,
but they were only used by the employés and officials.
General Kuntzler, his lieutenant, Maximoff, and four of
the subordinates, resided on the premises. They had rooms
in various parts of the building.</p>

<p>A careful study of the building, its approaches and its
exits, led Danevitch to the conclusion that the thief or
thieves must have reached the hall from one of the
numerous Government offices on the ground-floor of the
block, or from the direction of Kuntzler’s apartments, and
he set to work to try and determine that point. He found
that one of the offices referred to was used as a depository
for documents relating to Treasury business, and beneath
it, in the basement, was an arched cellar, also used for
storing documents. This cellar was one of many others,
all connected with a concreted subway, which in turn was
connected with the upper stories by a narrow staircase,
considered strictly private, and used, or supposed to be
used, by the employés only. The office was officially
known as Bureau 7. Exit from it could be had by a door,
which opened into a cul-de-sac, and was not a public
thoroughfare. It was, in fact, a narrow alley, formed by
the Treasury buildings and a church.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Danevitch was not slow to perceive that Bureau 7 and
the cul-de-sac offered the best, if not the only, means of
egress to anyone who, being on the premises illegally,
wished to escape without being seen. It was true that
one of the sentries always on duty patrolled the cul-de-sac
at intervals; but that, to the mind of Danevitch, was not
an insuperable obstacle to the escape of anyone from the
building. Of course, up to this point it was all conjecture,
all theory; but the astute detective brought all his faculties
to bear to prove that his theory was a reasonable one.</p>

<p>He ascertained that the door into the cul-de-sac was
very rarely used indeed, and had not been opened for a
long time, as the office itself was only a store-room for
documents, and days often passed without anyone going
into it. Critical examination, however, revealed to Danevitch
that the outer door had been very recently opened.
This was determined by many minute signs, which revealed
themselves to the quick and practised eyes of the detective.
But something more was forthcoming to confirm him in
his theory. On the floor of Bureau 7 he found two or
three diamonds, and in the passage of the cul-de-sac he
picked up some more. Here, then, at once was fairly
positive proof that the thief or thieves had made their
exit that way. Owing to rough handling, or to the jarring
together of the stolen things, some of the precious stones
had become detached, and by some carelessness or other a
number of them had fallen unperceived to the ground;
these as surely pointed the way taken by the robbers as
the lion in the desert betrays his track by the spoor. This
important discovery Danevitch kept to himself. He was
fond of likening his profession to a game at whist, and he
used to say that the cautious and skilful player should
never allow his opponent to know what cards he holds.</p>

<p>Having determined so much, his next step was to discover,
if possible, the guilty persons. It was tolerably
certain that, whoever they were, they must have been well
acquainted with the premises. Of course it went without
saying that no one could have undertaken and carried
out such an extraordinary robbery without first of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
making a very careful study of every detail, as well as of
every means of reaching the booty, and of conveying it
away when secured. The fact of the robbery having been
committed on the Wednesday, which was a Government
holiday, showed that it had been well planned, and it was
equally evident that somebody concerned in it was intimately
acquainted with the premises and all their ramifications.
The importance of the discovery of the way by
which the criminals had effected their escape could not be
overrated, and yet it was of still greater importance that
the way by which they entered should be determined. To
do that, however, was not an easy matter. The probability—a
strong probability—was that those concerned had lain
perdu in the building from the closing-time on Tuesday
night until the business was completed, which must have
been during the hours of darkness from Tuesday night to
Wednesday morning, or Wednesday night and Thursday
morning. In the latter case, however, the enterprising
‘exploiters’ must have remained on the premises the whole
of Wednesday, and that was hardly likely. They certainly
could not have entered on Wednesday, because as it was a
non-business day a stranger or strangers seeking admission
would have been challenged by the sentries, and not allowed
to pass without a special permit. At night a password
was always sent round to the people residing in the building,
and if they went out they could not gain entrance
again without giving the password. These precautions
were, in an ordinary way, no doubt, effective enough; but
the fact that on this occasion they had proved of no avail
pointed to one thing certain, which was that the intruders
had gained admission on the Tuesday with the general
public, but did not leave when the Museum was closed for
the night, and to another thing, not so certain, but
probable, that they had been assisted by somebody living
on the premises.</p>

<p>Altogether something like sixty persons had lodgings in
the Treasury buildings, but only fourteen of these persons,
including Kuntzler himself, were attached to the Museum
portion. The General’s apartments were just above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
hall in which the Crown jewels were kept. He had a suite
of six rooms, including a kitchen and a servant’s sleeping-place.
He was a widower, but his sister lived with him as
his housekeeper. She was a widow; her name was Anna
Ivanorna. The General also had an adopted daughter, a
pretty girl, about twenty years of age: she was called
Lydia. It appeared she was the natural child of one of
the General’s comrades, who had been killed during an
<i>émeute</i> in Siberia, where he was stationed on duty. On the
death of his friend, and being childless himself, Kuntzler
took the girl, then between six and seven years of age, and
brought her up. For obvious reasons, of course, Danevitch
made a study of the General’s household, and so learned
the foregoing particulars.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the General’s death was a terrible
blow to his family, and Lydia suffered such anguish that
she fell very ill. Necessarily it became the duty of Danevitch
to endeavour to ascertain by every means in his
power if Kuntzler’s suicide had resulted from any guilty
knowledge of the robbery. But not a scrap of evidence
was forthcoming to justify suspicion, though the outside
public suspected him. That, perhaps, was only natural.
As a matter of fact, however, he bore a very high reputation.
He had held many important positions of trust, and
had been elected to the post of Crown Jewel Keeper, on
the death of his predecessor, on account of the confidence
reposed in him by the Government, and during the time
he had held the office he had given the utmost satisfaction.
An examination of his books—he had to keep an account
of all the expenses in connection with his department—his
papers and private letters, did not bring to light a single
item that was calculated to arouse suspicion, and not a
soul in the Government service breathed a word against
him, while he was highly respected and esteemed by a very
large circle of friends.</p>

<p>It was admitted on all sides that General Kuntzler was
a very conscientious and sensitive man. The knowledge
of the robbery came upon him with a suddenness that
overwhelmed him, and, half stunned by the shock, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
mind gave way, and he adopted the weak man’s method
to relieve himself of a terrible responsibility. That was
the worst that anyone who knew him ventured to say;
he was accorded a public and a military funeral, and was
carried to his last resting-place amidst the genuine sorrow
of great numbers of people.</p>

<p>‘I confess that at this stage of the proceedings,’ writes
Danevitch in his notes of the case, ‘I did not feel very
sanguine of success in the task imposed upon me; and
when Colonel Andreyeff, Chief of the Moscow Police, sent
for me, and asked my views, I frankly told him what I
thought, keeping back, however, for the time being, the
discovery I had made, that the culprits had departed
from the building by Bureau 7, and had scattered some
diamonds on the way. The Colonel became very grave
when he learnt my opinion, and paid me the compliment of
saying that great hopes had been placed on me, that the
reputation of his department was at stake, and if the
jewels were not recovered, and the culprits brought to
justice, it might cost him his position. I pointed out that
I was quite incapable of performing miracles; that while
I could modestly claim to have been more successful in my
career than any other man following the same calling, it
was not within my power to see through stone walls, or
divine the innermost secrets of men’s hearts.</p>

<p>‘“But you are capable of reading signs which other men
have no eyes for,” exclaimed the Colonel.</p>

<p>‘“Possibly,” I answered, as I bowed my thanks for
the good opinion he held of me; “but in this instance
I see no sign.”</p>

<p>‘“But you are searching for one?” said the Colonel
anxiously.</p>

<p>‘“Oh, certainly I am,” I responded.</p>

<p>‘The anxious expression faded from the Colonel’s face, and
he smiled as, fixing his keen gray eyes on me, he remarked:</p>

<p>‘“As long as you are still searching for a sign, Danevitch,
there is hope. There must be a sign somewhere,
and unless you have grown blind and mentally dull, it will
not escape you for long.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>‘This was very flattering to my <i>amour propre</i>, and I
admit that it had a tendency to stimulate me to renewed
exertion, if stimulus was really needed. But, as a matter
of fact, I was not just then very hopeful. Nevertheless, as
I took my leave, I said that, if the problem was solvable
by mortal man, I would solve it. This was pledging
myself to a good deal; but I was vain enough to think
that, if I failed by methods which I had made a lifelong
study, to say nothing of a natural gift for my work, no
one else was likely to succeed, except by some accident
which would give him the advantage.’</p>

<p>Like most men of exceptional ability, Danevitch was
conscious of his strength, but he rarely allowed this self-consciousness
to assert itself, and when he did he was
justified. His methods were certainly his own, and he
never liked to own defeat. That meant that where he
failed it was hardly likely anyone else would have succeeded.
Not only had he a tongue cunning to question,
an eye quick to observe, but, as I have said elsewhere, a
sort of eighth sense, which enabled him to discern what
other men could not discern.</p>

<p>After that interview with Colonel Andreyeff, he fell to
pondering on the case, and bringing all the logic he was
capable of to bear. He saw no reason whatever to change
his first opinion, that there had been an enemy in the
camp. By that is meant that the robbery could never
have been effected unless with the aid of someone connected
with the place, and knowing it well. Following his course
of reasoning, he came to the decision that the stolen
property was still within the Kremlin. His reason for
this was, as he states:</p>

<p>‘The thieves could not have passed out during the night,
as they would have been questioned by the guards at the
gates. Nor could they have conveyed out such a bulky
packet on Wednesday, as they would have been called upon
for a permit. On the other hand, if the property had been
divided up into small parcels, the risk would have been
great, and suspicion aroused. But assuming that the
thieves had been stupid enough to carry off the things in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
bulk, they must have known that they were not likely to
get far before attracting attention, while any attempt to
dispose of the articles as they were would have been fatal.
To have been blind to these tremendous risks was to argue
a denseness on the part of the culprits hardly conceivable
of men who had been clever enough to abstract from a
sentry-guarded Government building property of such
enormous value. They would know well enough that
melted gold and loose gems could always find a market;
but, having regard to the hue and cry, that market was
hardly likely to be sought for in any part of Russia.
Therefore, when reduced to an unrecognisable state, and
when vigilance had been relaxed, the gold and the jewels
would be carried abroad to some of the centres of Europe,
where the infamous receiver flourishes and waxes fat on the
sins of his fellow-men.</p>

<p>‘In accordance with my custom in such cases,’ continues
Danevitch in his notes, ‘I lost not a moment when I took
up the case in telegraphing to every outlet from Russia,
including the frontier posts. I knew, therefore, that at
every frontier station and every outlet luggage would be
subjected to very critical examination, and the thieves
would experience great difficulty indeed in getting clear.
But there was another aspect of the case that could not be
overlooked, and it caused me considerable anxiety; it was
this—the gems could be carried away a few at a time. A
woman, for instance, could conceal about her person small
packets of them, and excite no suspicion. To examine
everyone personally at the frontiers was next to impossible.
There was another side, however, to this view, and it
afforded me some consolation. To get the gems out of the
country in the way suggested would necessitate a good
many journeys on the part of the culprits, and one person
making the same journey several times would excite
suspicion. If several people were employed in the work,
they would be certain to get at loggerheads sooner or
later, and the whole business would be exposed. I always
made it a sort of axiom that “when thieves fall out honest
men come by their due,” and experience had taught me that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
thieves invariably fall out when it comes to a division of
plunder. Of course, I was perfectly alive to the fact that
it would not do to rely upon that; something more was
wanted: it was of the highest importance to prevent the
stolen property being carried far away, and all my energies
were concentrated to that end.</p>

<p>‘I have already given my reasons for thinking that at
this stage the stolen jewels had not been removed from
the Kremlin. Although there are no regular streets, as
understood, in the Kremlin, there are numerous shops and
private residences, the latter being inhabited for the most
part by the officials and other employés of the numerous
Government establishments. The result is that within
the Kremlin itself there is a very large population.’</p>

<p>It will be seen from these particulars that the whole
affair bristled with difficulties, and, given that the thieves
were sharp, shrewd, and cautious, they might succeed in
defeating Danevitch’s efforts. One of the first things he
did was to request that every sentry at the Kremlin gates
should be extra vigilant, and subject passers to and fro to
more than ordinary observation, while if they had reason
to suspect any particular person, that person should be
instantly arrested. The precautions which were thus
taken reduced the matter to a game of chance. If the
thieves betrayed themselves by an incautious or careless
act they would lose. On the other hand, if they were
skilful and vigilant the detective would be defeated; and
as the stakes were very large, and to lose meant death to
them (that being the penalty in Russia for such a crime), it
was presumable that they would not easily sacrifice themselves.
At this stage Danevitch himself confessed that he
would not have ventured to give an opinion as to which of
the two sides would win.</p>

<p>The more Danevitch studied the subject, the more he
became convinced that the thieves must have been in league
with someone connected with the Treasury Department.
In face of the fact that false keys had been used, the
theory of collusion could not be ignored; the difficulty
was to determine who was the most likely person to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
have proved traitor to his trust. Maximoff bore a high
character; General Kuntzler had reposed full confidence
in him. The subordinates were also men of good repute.
That, however, was not a guarantee that they were proof
against temptation. Nevertheless, Danevitch could not
get hold of anything that was calculated to arouse his
suspicion against any particular individual. If there was
a guilty man amongst them, he would, of course, be particularly
careful not to commit any act, or utter any
word, calculated to betray him, knowing as he did that
Danevitch was on the alert.</p>

<p>When several days had passed, and General Kuntzler
had been consigned to his tomb, Danevitch had an interview
with his sister, Anna Ivanorna. She was in a state
of great mental excitement and nervous prostration; and
Lydia, the General’s adopted daughter, was also very ill.
Anna was a somewhat remarkable woman. She was a tall,
big-boned, determined-looking individual, with a soured
expression of face and restless gray eyes. Her manner of
speaking, her expression of face, and a certain cynicism,
which made itself apparent in her talk, gave one the notion
that she was a disappointed woman.</p>

<p>‘This is a sad business,’ began Danevitch, after some
preliminary remarks.</p>

<p>‘Very sad,’ she answered. ‘It has cost my brother his
life.’</p>

<p>‘He evidently felt it very keenly,’ said Danevitch.</p>

<p>‘A man must feel a thing keenly to commit suicide,
unless he is a weak-brained fool, incapable of any endurance,’
she replied with a warmth that amounted almost to
fierceness. After a pause, she added: ‘My brother was
far from being a fool. He was a strong man—a clever
man.’</p>

<p>‘So I understand. Did he make any observation to you
before he committed the rash act?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, he did, Anna,’ cried out Lydia from the couch on
which she was lying, wrapped in rugs.</p>

<p>Anna turned upon her angrily, and exclaimed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>‘How do you know? Hold your tongue. He made no
observation, I say.’</p>

<p>Lydia was evidently annoyed at being spoken to in such
a manner, and she replied with spirit, as she raised herself
on her elbow:</p>

<p>‘Don’t snap at me like that, Anna. I know perfectly
well. My poor father said over and over again that he
had been betrayed, that there had been a traitor in the
house. It was that that distracted him. He couldn’t
bear the thought of it.’</p>

<p>‘And who do you suppose the traitor was?’ Anna asked
angrily. ‘You are always thinking wrong of people.’</p>

<p>Lydia did not take any notice of this. She lay still,
and seemed to be suffering; keen mental anguish.</p>

<p>‘Have you any opinion how the robbery was committed?’
asked Danevitch of Anna.</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘But surely you must have some idea.’</p>

<p>‘No, I haven’t.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think it possible, now, that such a crime could
have been committed without a confederate in the camp?’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ demanded the woman sternly, as
though she resented the bare suspicion which the question
implied.</p>

<p>‘My meaning is plain, surely. An utter stranger to the
place could not have done this deed.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose he couldn’t. But whoever did it couldn’t
have been an utter stranger.’</p>

<p>‘Do I understand from that that you suggest the culprit
or culprits are people who were employed here?’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t suggest that. But it stands to reason that
anyone undertaking a deed of this kind would be careful
to make himself acquainted with the building.’</p>

<p>‘And how do you think he did that?’</p>

<p>‘You know as well as I do that the place is open to the
public. What is there to prevent anyone studying the
place?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing whatever, so far as the public part of it goes.
But, unless with the aid of a confederate, I do not quite see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
how anyone could become acquainted with those parts
where the public are not admitted.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Mr. Danevitch,’ said Anna, with a decisiveness
which was meant to clinch the argument, ‘I am not an
expert like you, nor do I know anything at all about the
matter, therefore don’t bother me with any more questions.
I am troubled enough, and have enough on my mind without
this affair. I want to forget it.’</p>

<p>‘I make every allowance for you,’ replied Danevitch.
‘I quite understand that your feelings are lacerated, but
I thought it was within the bounds of possibility that
you might be able to throw some light on the matter.
However, I will not disturb you further, but take my
leave.’</p>

<p>Anna showed him out with a sigh of relief, and she shut
the door with a bang that indicated too plainly how glad
she was to get rid of him. At this stage, Danevitch
writes, he felt in a quandary. There were certain signs
that suggested probabilities, but it was not easy to determine
just then whether or not the signs were anything
more than shadows, by which he might be misled.
Speculation and theory were all he had to guide him, and
he was only too well aware that the most astute of
reasoners is apt to be misled. What necessarily concerned
him was the danger of being led out of the true track by
a false sign. He was not indifferent, of course, to the fact
that he had made some progress—that is to say, he had
determined pretty conclusively how the thieves had left
the Treasury buildings when once they had secured their
booty. But what was of still greater importance was to
discover how they got in. Could he solve that part of the
problem, he felt sure it would give him many points.</p>

<p>It was remarkable about Danevitch that, while he was
often mistrustful about his own instincts, he seldom erred.
He had made human nature so close a study that the
person who, as the saying is, could have thrown dust in
his eyes would have had to have been preternaturally
clever. He maintained, and proved it over and over again,
that the face was so certain an index to what was passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
in the mind that every thought of the brain was communicated
instantly to the features, which indicated it
as unmistakably as a delicately-balanced needle notes
the slightest current of electricity. Of course, it was
necessary to understand these face-signs. That in itself is
a science. Indeed, the power to understand it is a gift,
and he who fully possesses it is what is termed to-day ‘a
thought-reader.’ Danevitch did not call himself that, but
he possessed the power in a marked degree, nevertheless;
and no one could be indifferent to the extraordinary
strength and power of his eyes. When he looked at you,
you felt somehow as if he was looking right into your
brain. Mr. Gladstone is said to have that peculiar eye,
and it can readily be understood that anyone with guilty
knowledge having to meet the piercing gaze of such an
eye is almost sure to betray himself by face-signs, which
to the expert are full of meaning. Danevitch had brought
this study to such perfection that it proved invaluable to
him, and often afforded him a clue which otherwise he
would never have got. Another strong trait in his character
was the persistency with which he stuck to an idea when
once he had thought it out. That, again, was largely
responsible for the success that attended his efforts in the
art of solving criminal problems. Of course, his ideas
were generally very sound ones, and the result of much
cogitation. He never jumped to hasty conclusions.</p>

<p>The foregoing little disquisition is not out of place in
view of what follows, and will certainly add to the reader’s
interest.</p>

<p>About three weeks after that interview between Danevitch
and Anna Ivanorna, three men were seated in a
restaurant situated in what is known as the Zemlidnoi-gorod,
which, being interpreted, means ‘earthen town,’ and
it is so called because at one time it was surrounded by an
earthen rampart. This part of Moscow contains a number
of drinking-places, spirit-stores, shops, cafés and restaurants.
The one in which the three men were seated was a very
typical Russian fifth-rate house. The ceiling was black
with smoke. Flimsy and frouzy curtains hung at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
windows; the floor was sanded; long, rough, wooden
tables, forms, and common chairs constituted the furniture.
At one end of the room was a small counter, covered with
lead, on which stood sundry bottles, glasses, and plates of
caviare and sandwiches; at the other end was the indispensable
stove—a huge affair with a massive convoluted
iron flue, that was suggestive of a boa constrictor.</p>

<p>The night being very cold, the three men were crowded
round the stove, engaged in deep and earnest conversation.
Two of the men were young; one about two or three and
twenty, the other a year or two older. They were well
dressed, and apparently belonged to a class not given to
frequenting drinking-places of that kind. The third man
was of a somewhat striking appearance. He was swarthy
as a gipsy—a black beard and moustache, black eyes, black
hair, cropped close to the skull. In his ears he wore small
gold rings, and his style, manner, and dress proclaimed him
unmistakably a seafaring man.</p>

<p>Presently the glazed door of the shop swung open, and
a Jew tumbled in. He was heavily bearded; on his head
was a small black, tightly-fitting skull-cap. He wore long
boots, with his trousers, which were very baggy, tucked into
the tops, and a fur-lined coat, which must have been in
existence for a generation at least. He divested himself
of this coat and hung it on a peg, and then ordered vodka
and caviare.</p>

<p>The three men ceased their conversation when the
stranger entered; and he, when he had finished his repast,
rose, and with somewhat unsteady gait, as if he had been
drinking, walked to the stove and asked if he might be
allowed a seat there. The other three, with by no means
good grace, made room for him. The seafaring man was
smoking a very black, very strong cigar. The Jew produced
from his pocket a huge pipe, and, filling it with
coarse tobacco, asked the seafarer for a light, which was
given. When his pipe was fairly in swing, he said to the
man with the cigar:</p>

<p>‘Unless I’m mistaken, you reek of the salt sea.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose I do,’ answered the other brusquely. ‘Any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
way, I’ve been soaked with it often enough. Where are
you from?’</p>

<p>‘Constantinople.’</p>

<p>‘So. A trader, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘What do you trade in?’</p>

<p>‘Anything on earth, so long as it will turn me in
money.’</p>

<p>‘Bah!’ sneered one of the young men—‘just like you
Jew dogs. It’s always money with you—money, money.
It’s your only prayer.’</p>

<p>‘In that respect I’m not sure that there is much
difference between the Jew dog and the grasping Christian.
But I don’t want to quarrel with you. I’m a stranger in
the town. Will you drink at my expense?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered the three as one man.</p>

<p>So drink was ordered, and for a time the conversation
was friendly and general, and when it flagged a little the
Jew said:</p>

<p>‘That’s a curious robbery that has taken place lately.’</p>

<p>‘What robbery?’ asked one of the young men, eyeing
the Jew keenly.</p>

<p>‘The robbery of the Crown jewels.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes; very curious.’</p>

<p>‘By Father Abraham!’ exclaimed the Jew, with a great
puffing out of his breath, ‘but I should like to call some
of the precious stones mine. The God of Jacob! I wonder
what has become of them. They haven’t caught the
thieves yet, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ was the curt answer.</p>

<p>‘Ah! they are clever fellows; must be wonderfully
clever to do such a deed. But I expect they’ll be laid by
the heels yet.’</p>

<p>‘No fear,’ answered one of the youngsters. ‘You can
depend upon it they know what they are about.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! just so, just so,’ mused the Jew—‘just so. It’s a
clever bit of business—clever, clever; by God it is! I
wonder, now, what has become of those jewels. They are
worth risking body and soul for.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>‘I say, stranger,’ remarked the seafarer, ‘you had better
be careful what you say, or you may land yourself in
trouble.’</p>

<p>‘True, true, true!’ moaned the Jew. ‘But, God in
heaven, only to think of all those precious gems! It
almost turns one’s brain.’</p>

<p>He sank into a moody silence, and stared fixedly at the
stove, as though he was dreaming dreams about the gems.
The other three men conversed in low tones for a little
time, until the two younger ones rose up, said ‘Good-night,’
and left, for the hour was getting late. Then the
Jew seemed suddenly to wake up from his reverie, and he
asked the seafarer if he was going.</p>

<p>‘No; I am lodging here,’ was the answer.</p>

<p>‘So. That reminds me. Landlord, can I have a bed?’</p>

<p>He was told he could. There was some haggling about
the price to be paid, but the matter was amicably settled
in the end, and the Jew invited the seafarer to have some
more vodka. True to the traditions of his kind the world
over, the sailor man accepted the invitation, and the two
sat drinking until the landlord came to remind them it
was time they retired.</p>

<p>The sailor was pretty far gone in his cups, and the Jew
offered to assist him up the stairs to bed. With some
difficulty the pair managed to mount the greasy, rickety
stairs to where the sleeping chambers were, and the Jew
accompanied the sailor man to his room, and then from
his capacious pocket he produced a bottle of vodka, and
they set to work to discuss it. Presently the Jew
murmured in a maudlin way, as his thoughts still ran upon
the gems:</p>

<p>‘By Father Abraham, but it was a big haul! Why,
there must have been a million roubles’ worth of them.’</p>

<p>‘Of what?’ asked the skipper, who, though pretty well
soaked, seemed to have his wits about him.</p>

<p>‘The stolen jewels,’ mumbled the Jew. ‘I would buy
every one of them at a price; I would, so help me God!’</p>

<p>‘Now, what price would you give?’</p>

<p>‘How could I tell—how could I tell, unless I saw them?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>The sailor man became thoughtful and silent, and the
Jew sank down in a corner like a sack, mumbling incoherently
guttural sentences, in which the words ‘gems,
jewels, gold,’ predominated. Presently the sailor was overcome
by his potations, and stretching himself on the bed,
boots and all, was soon snoring in drunken sleep. A
couple of hours later the Jew crept from the room, sought
his own chamber, and was speedily sound asleep in the
bed.</p>

<p>The next morning the two men drank their tea together,
and having lighted one of his long black cigars, the sailor
invited the Jew forth into the city.</p>

<p>‘You say you are from Constantinople?’ asked the
sailor, as they walked together.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Do you reside there?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘In what part?’</p>

<p>‘The Jews’ quarter.’</p>

<p>‘And, I suppose, like all your tribe, you don’t know
your own wealth?’</p>

<p>The Jew sighed dolefully.</p>

<p>‘Alas, alas!’ he exclaimed; ‘by Abraham in heaven, I
swear I am very poor.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! you all say that.’</p>

<p>‘It’s true, it’s true. But why do you ask?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, nothing; only, if you had been rich, I might have
put something in your way by which you could have
doubled your riches.’</p>

<p>‘What is it? What is it?’ cried the Jew eagerly.
‘Tell me; I can get money. Thousands, tens of thousands,
millions of roubles, if needs be. But tell me what
it is. I want to grow rich; I want money—want it by
sackfuls. It is my dream; I worship it.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ grunted the sailor, with a smack of his lips, ‘you
are all alike. Have you any friends in Moscow?’</p>

<p>‘No; I am a stranger. I have come to trade. I will
lend money at interest on good security, or I will buy anything
that I can sell again.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>The sailor became very thoughtful. He puffed away at
his rank cigar like a man who was deeply absorbed, and
the Jew ambled on by his side, mumbling to himself.
Presently the sailor addressed him:</p>

<p>‘Do you stay in the same lodgings to-night?’</p>

<p>‘I do.’</p>

<p>‘Good. I’ll meet you at nine o’clock, and may be able
to put something in your way. I must leave you now.’</p>

<p>‘Count on me,’ said the Jew. ‘If we can do a deal
together, I’ll put money in your purse.’</p>

<p>‘You bet you will! You don’t suppose I’m going to
serve you without serving myself. I don’t love your race
enough for that. It’s a matter of convenience. But till
to-night, adieu.’</p>

<p>‘By the way, how are you called?’</p>

<p>‘I am known as Captain Blok. I command a small
trader doing business in the Black Sea.’</p>

<p>‘Where is she now?’</p>

<p>‘She is being overhauled at Azov.’</p>

<p>‘Will you be alone to-night?’</p>

<p>‘No. The two friends you saw last night may be with me.’</p>

<p>‘Good. This looks like business. I will meet you
without fail.’</p>

<p>The sailor went off, and the Jew continued his jaunt
through the town. When nine o’clock came, it found him
by the big stove in the restaurant. There were several
other customers there, but he held aloof from them, for
one had a little before called him ‘a dog of a Jew,’ saying
he had no business to be there amongst Christians, and
tried to pick a quarrel with him. As a quarter-past nine
struck, Captain Blok entered. He was alone. He addressed
a few preliminary remarks to the Jew, then requested that
he would follow him to his bedroom.</p>

<p>‘What is your name, Jew?’ asked Blok, as he shut the
door.</p>

<p>‘Nikolai—Israel Nikolai.’</p>

<p>‘Are you a Russian?’</p>

<p>‘I was born in Poland, but have been trading in
Constantinople and the Levant for many years.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>‘You are good for a deal in a big way?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘And can be secret?’</p>

<p>‘As the grave.’</p>

<p>At this point the door opened, and Blok’s companions
of the previous night entered. They looked at Blok inquiringly,
then at the Jew suspiciously.</p>

<p>‘He’s right,’ said Blok. Then turning to the Jew, he
continued: ‘Now look here, Israel Nikolai, you say you
can command money?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, to any extent.’</p>

<p>‘Very well; now, we’ve got some stuff to sell, and we are
going to take you to see it. The stuff is contraband,
therefore you must be careful. And if you play us false,
just as sure as God Almighty is up in heaven, your throat
will be cut, and your dirty carcase will be flung into the
river Maskva.’</p>

<p>The Jew smote his breast, and wailed out with passionate
eagerness:</p>

<p>‘Trust me—trust me! To those whom I serve, I am as
stanch as steel.’</p>

<p>‘That’s right. Now, then, come with us.’</p>

<p>The four men descended the greasy staircase, and went
forth into the street. It was an intensely dark night. A
few hazy stars were alone visible in the black sky. The
street-lamps in that part were very poor affairs, and gave
but little light. The four proceeded for a short distance;
then Blok said:</p>

<p>‘Nikolai, before we go any further, you must let us
blindfold you.’</p>

<p>The Jew protested, but at last yielded, and a thick scarf
was bound about his eyes. Then one of the men took his
hand and led him. They walked along in silence for quite
half an hour, until, by the sound of flowing water, the Jew
knew he was near the river. A halt was made. There
was the grating of keys in a lock, a door was opened, and
Israel was led forward into a passage, while the door was
locked and barred. He was then taken down a flight of
stairs, where the bandage was removed from his eyes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
a light was procured. He found himself in a cellar, with
an arched brick roof, from which water dripped, while the
floor of red brick was slimy and foul. The place was
furnished with a single trestle table and a stool or two.
In one corner was a large trunk, bound with cowhide.
This was opened, and some bundles lifted out, placed on
the table, and untied, and there were revealed to the wondering
Jew heaps of precious stones, including diamonds,
rubies, amethysts, pearls, sapphires, turquoises. At the
sight of the gems the Jew rubbed his hands together, and
his eyes glistened with almost unnatural brilliancy.</p>

<p>‘Father Abraham!’ he exclaimed. ‘What wealth!
what a fortune! Are they all real? Let me feel them;
let me examine them.’</p>

<p>Blok so held the lamp that its rays were thrown full on
to the heaps of gems, and the three men watched the Jew’s
every movement. He examined the stones carefully, picked
out some of the finest, weighing them in his hands, holding
them close to the light so as to see them better, then
placing them in little heaps.</p>

<p>A full hour was spent in this way. But few remarks
were made, though every now and again the Jew broke
into an exclamation of delight. At length Blok asked
Nikolai what he thought of them.</p>

<p>‘Splendid! wonderful! magnificent!’ was the gasped
answer.</p>

<p>‘Now, then, are you open to trade?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Will you buy the lot?’</p>

<p>‘At what figure?’</p>

<p>‘A million roubles.’</p>

<p>The Jew started back with a look of disgust on his
face.</p>

<p>‘It is too much—too much!’ he almost screamed.
‘They are not worth it.’</p>

<p>‘You lie, you dog!’ put in one of the young men.
‘You know they are worth a good deal more. But we
want to sell them quickly, and you shall have them as a
bargain for a million roubles.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Nikolai groaned, swore, protested, declared by all the
fathers that the price was outrageous, and at last, when he
had exhausted himself, he wound up by offering seventy-five
thousand roubles for the lot. After much haggling,
the three men agreed to take the price, and Nikolai said
he would go next day to the Bank of Moscow, to which
he had letters, and draw the money, and it was arranged
that the four men were to meet the following night outside
of the restaurant, and proceed again to the cellar,
where the money would be exchanged for the jewels. And
Blok added:</p>

<p>‘As soon as the bargain’s completed, you had better
clear out. You can travel with me to Azov, if you like,
and I’ll give you a cheap passage to Constantinople.’</p>

<p>The Jew turned to Blok, with a glance full of meaning,
and replied:</p>

<p>‘I may sail with you, but I’ll send my jewels a safer
way.’</p>

<p>The business, so far, being concluded, Nikolai was once
more blindfolded. The lamp was extinguished, and they
all left the house together. After going some distance,
the bandage was removed from the Jew’s eyes. The two
young men went away, and Blok and Israel continued
their walk to their lodgings.</p>

<p>The following morning Nikolai told Blok that he was
going to the bank to arrange about the money, but that
the deal would have to take place that evening in their
bedroom at the café, as he would not trust himself with
them in the cellar with so much money about him. To
this Blok answered that the transaction would have to be
arranged in the cellar, that everything would be perfectly
square and fair.</p>

<p>Reluctantly the Jew yielded, and went away. He met
the captain again in the evening at the restaurant, and
Blok anxiously inquired if he had got the money, whereupon
the Jew pulled from a deep pocket inside his vest
a bundle of notes, the sight of which caused the captain’s
eyes to sparkle.</p>

<p>A little later they set off, being met on the route by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
two young men. Nikolai resolutely declined to be blindfolded
again. He said there was no necessity for it. He
also warned his companions that he was well armed, and
was prepared to resent any treachery. They laughed, and
said he was a fool not to see that they were anxious to
trade, and not likely to offer violence, which would imperil
their own safety.</p>

<p>The house by the river was at last reached. It had
formerly been a store of some sort, but had apparently
long been untenanted, and was falling into decay. One of
the young men had inserted the key into the lock of the
door, and was about to turn it, when a whistle was blown,
and almost as if it was by magic the four found themselves
surrounded by armed men, who seemed to come through
the earth. Before they could offer the slightest resistance,
Blok and the two young men were seized and ironed, and a
guard set over them. Then a police officer, the Jew, and
three or four other men, entered the premises, descended
to the cellar, and, having ascertained that the gems were
in the trunk, they bore the trunk out, and placed it on a
cart that was in readiness, and under a strong escort the
stolen jewels were conveyed to the Treasury, where several
high officials were waiting to receive them; and Blok and
his companions realized that they had been tricked,
trapped, and betrayed by the ‘dog of a Jew,’ who was
none other than Danevitch.</p>

<p>He says it was one of the proudest moments of his life,
for his part had been played with consummate art, and his
triumph was complete. It remains now to explain how he
managed to get on the track of his men, and net them so
cleverly.</p>

<p>After his interview with Anna Ivanorna, he began to
think that she could throw some light on the mystery if
she liked, and he had her shadowed. He ascertained from
Lydia that Ivanorna had a son about five-and-twenty.
He had paid court to Lydia, but she did not like him. A
few months before the robbery this young man had spent
a fortnight with his mother during the temporary absence
of General Kuntzler. His mother was blindly devoted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
him, although he was known to be an idle, dissolute vagabond.
He had been well educated, and had once held a
position in the Post Office, but had been discharged for
some irregularity. His name was Peter, and one night,
some days after the robbery, he and his mother were
seen to meet in a lonely part of the suburbs.</p>

<p>From that moment a close watch was kept on Peter’s
movements, and it was ascertained that he was associated
with another young man, called Maiefski. They were
always together, and in a little while were joined by Blok,
who was Peter’s half-cousin. The old disused store on the
banks of the river was taken in Maiefski’s name, ostensibly
to store grain there; but little by little the gems from
the stolen articles, which were ruthlessly broken up,
were conveyed from a house in the Kremlin which
Peter rented to the place on the river bank.</p>

<p>Blok had secured lodgings in the miserable restaurant in
the poor quarter of the earthen city, as he hoped thereby
to escape attracting any notice. At this restaurant the
three rascals were in the habit of meeting. Then it was
that Danevitch, being sure of his ground, assumed so
successfully the rôle of the Jew.</p>

<p>On the night when he and Captain Blok staggered up
to the latter’s room, Danevitch was perfectly sober,
although he assumed the gait and manner of an intoxicated
person. When Blok had gone to sleep, Danevitch
searched his person, and in a pocket-book found letters of
a most compromising character. They seemed to show
that the first idea was that the three men were to travel
singly to Azov, each man carrying as many of the gems as
he could without causing suspicions. They were to be
deposited on Blok’s vessel, and when all was ready Blok
and his companions were to sail away to Constantinople,
where they hoped to dispose of the gems, but if not, they
were to take a journey to Persia, where precious stones could
always be sold.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Jew on the scene altered their
plans, and they thought if they could only get him to buy
them their risk would be greatly lessened, and the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
they touched the money they were prepared to clear out,
and seek safety in some other country. Their little
scheme, however, was entirely frustrated, thanks to the
cleverness of Danevitch.</p>

<p>At Peter’s lodgings the battered gold of the stolen
property was found, but ultimately the Polish crown was
restored almost to its original state, and may still be seen
in the museum at Moscow.</p>

<p>As the plot of the robbery was gradually unfolded, it
was proved that Anna Ivanorna was the victim of her
perfidious son. She was a weak, rather stupid woman—at
any rate, where he was concerned—and she fell a victim
to his wiles and wickedness. If she did not actually assist
him, she shut her eyes while he made wax impressions of
various keys, and on the night of the robbery she unquestionably
helped him and his companion, Maiefski, who was
secretly admitted. It is possible that, when Kuntzler
heard of the crime, he had some suspicion that his sister
knew something about it, and, unable to face the awful
shame of exposure, he took his life.</p>

<p>Neither Maximoff nor his subordinates had anything to
do with the robbery. They were all exonerated after a
most exhaustive investigation, which led to the conviction
of the guilty parties, who, with the exception of Anna,
were sent to the Siberian mines for life. She was condemned
to ten years’ incarceration in the prison fortress
of Schlusselburgh. That was practically a living death.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE STRANGE STORY OF A SECRET
TREATY.</h3>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">I received</span> orders,’ says Danevitch, ‘to proceed without
delay to the official residence in St. Petersburg of Prince
Ignatof,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who was then Minister of Foreign Affairs. He
had the reputation of being one of the most powerful
Ministers who had ever held the position in Russia. It
was said of him, as it used to be said of Bismarck, that he
was a man of blood and iron. He was dead to emotion;
he had no nerves; he was pitiless; he was anti-everything
that wasn’t Russian; but he was also a born diplomatist—clever,
brilliant, unscrupulous, far-seeing, polished as a
rapier, and as deadly as a rapier when occasion called
for it.</p>

<p>‘Such was the common report about him, and no doubt
it was, in the main, true. He was a widower, with one
grown-up daughter. There was a deadly feud, however,
between them, and he had disowned her, as she had chosen
to marry against his will, and very much beneath her, as
her father averred. Her husband was in the consular
service. His name was Kasin; he was a member of a
middle-class family who had made money in trade; but
Kasin himself was said to be poor, and almost entirely
dependent upon his salary.</p>



<p>‘These facts were common property, and naturally it
must have caused the Prince great annoyance to know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
his daughter’s name was in everyone’s mouth, and that she
was vulgarly referred to as the wife of a poor devil of a
consul, who found it difficult to rub two roubles together.
Caste is very strong in Russia, and the line of demarcation
separating class from class is exceedingly well defined.</p>

<p>‘The Prince was an utter stranger to me; I had heard
much about him, but had never seen him. On being
ushered into his bureau, I beheld a small-made, delicate-looking
man, with a remarkable and striking face. The
mouth was small and firm; the nose prominent; the eyes
deep-set, and of exceptional brilliancy; the eyebrows were
thin, but well defined; and the forehead, in proportion to
the small, sharply-cut features, seemed enormous. He was
slightly bald in front, and such hair as he had was turning
gray. His face was clean-shaven. When his lips parted,
he revealed a splendid set of teeth, absolutely without
a flaw.</p>

<p>‘As I looked upon this remarkable man, everything I had
heard about his personal character seemed to me to be
more than confirmed. It was impossible to study the
mouth without feeling that it was capable of uttering
cruel, cutting, bitter things. It was no less impossible
not to understand that the small, brilliant eyes could peer
into men’s brains, and almost read their secret thoughts.
Every line of his face, every feature, every glance, indicated
an iron, a relentless, will; and when he spoke, the smooth,
incisive tones confirmed this. His hands were small, well shaped,
but sinewy, as were his wrists. This was no doubt
due to many years’ practice with the sword and the foil.
He was a noted swordsman, had fought many duels, and
had always succeeded in either severely wounding or killing
his man. Physically and mentally he could be a deadly
antagonist; one glance at him was sufficient to determine
that fact, for fact it was.</p>

<p>‘He was perusing a document as I entered. He glanced
over the edge of the paper, motioned me to be seated, and
went on reading.</p>

<p>‘For ten minutes the silence was unbroken, save for the
rustle of the paper as he turned over the leaves. Only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
man of very pronounced characteristics could have remained
silent so long under such circumstances.</p>

<p>‘He finished his manuscript, folded it up, and placed it
in a safe. Then he condescended to address me.</p>

<p>‘“You have the reputation of being able to unravel
mysteries when other men fail?” he commenced.</p>

<p>‘I could only bow to this.</p>

<p>‘He drew an elegant little penknife from his pocket,
and began to trim his nails, but I noted that all the time
his piercing eyes were fixed on me.</p>

<p>‘“You are reliable?” was his next remark.</p>

<p>‘It was put in the form of a question. In other men
the remark might have seemed commonplace. Coming
from the Prince’s lips, it was full of meaning; it even
covered a menace. That is to say, it carried with it the
implication, “Woe betide you if you are not!”</p>

<p>‘“If I were otherwise,” I answered, “I should not occupy
the position I do.”</p>

<p>‘“True,” he replied. “Now, the matter in which I am
going to enlist your services is a delicate one.”</p>

<p>‘He paused, and fixed his eyes upon me again, and toyed
daintily with the penknife.</p>

<p>‘“I have had to do with many delicate cases,” I
said.</p>

<p>‘“Ah! And have been successful?”</p>

<p>‘“More frequently than not.”</p>

<p>‘“You’ve been employed in Government business
before?”</p>

<p>‘“Yes,” I answered shortly, as I felt somewhat annoyed
at the manner in which he put his questions.</p>

<p>‘“I am impressed with you,” he was good enough
to say.</p>

<p>‘I returned no answer to that, merely making a very
formal motion of the head.</p>

<p>‘“Our little introduction places us <i>en rapport</i> with each
other,” he continued, closing the blade of his penknife with
a snap. Even this remark was pregnant with meaning.
It really meant that he understood me, or believed that he
did. “And now I will tell you the business.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>‘He had been standing up to this moment, but here he
seated himself, crossed his legs, and thrust his hands into
his pockets. To the ordinary observer he would have
appeared as the most unconcerned person in the world, but
I could not fail to see that he was a master in the art of
restraint. It was not difficult to determine that, beneath
the cold, passionless, immobile face was tremendous
anxiety, and a suppressed nervous energy, that could
only be kept in subjection by extraordinary will-power.</p>

<p>‘“A special, confidential, and trusted courier,” he
continued, “arrived here yesterday afternoon, and placed
in my hands the draft of a secret treaty of the very
greatest importance.”</p>

<p>‘Here he paused again, and looked at me in his peculiar
manner, as if he was trying to thoroughly understand how
I was affected by the information he was giving me. Or,
on the other hand, it might have been that he had not
quite made up his mind whether or not I was a fit and
proper person to be entrusted with State business of such
a momentous nature.</p>

<p>‘“Pray proceed, Prince,” I said, with the greatest
unconcern.</p>

<p>‘“Bah!” he muttered, almost inaudibly, allowing irritation
to display itself for a brief instant. His irritation
arose, I inferred, because he failed to read me as easily as
he imagined he could do. Perhaps that was not quite the
case, but it was something of the kind. The exclamation
had scarcely left his lips when he broke into a smile—a cold,
cynical smile, but full of meaning. “That draft has been
stolen,” he added abruptly, and watched to see what effect
that announcement would have upon me.</p>

<p>‘But I merely said:</p>

<p>‘“I anticipated that.”</p>

<p>‘“Why?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>‘“By your manner, Prince.”</p>

<p>‘He smiled again, and said caustically:</p>

<p>‘“I didn’t know I was so shallow, and could be so easily
fathomed. But pardon me; I had forgotten for the
moment that you are a master in your craft. We shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
get on together. Yes, you are clever; the draft has been
stolen. What that means you will better understand when I
tell you that it may possibly plunge this country into war.”</p>

<p>‘“I recognise the seriousness of the matter, Prince,” I
said, “and, seeing how very serious it is, I would suggest
that there should be no restraint, no reserve. If I am to
be of use, I must not only have a free hand, but be trusted
absolutely.”</p>

<p>‘“You are right, you are right,” he replied quickly.
“But the whole business is fraught with such terrible
potentialities that extreme caution is needed.”</p>

<p>‘He rose, and paced up and down for some moments,
still keeping his hands in his pockets. His face betrayed
no agitation, but his manner did. Nevertheless, his self-restraint
was very remarkable. I waited for him to continue
the conversation, and presently he stopped and faced me.</p>

<p>‘“Ah, yes!” he said, speaking in an absorbed way.
“Well, these are the particulars: The courier, who had
been travelling night and day, arrived, as I have already
said, yesterday afternoon, and delivered to me a draft of a
treaty. Having perused it, I placed it in a despatch-box
and locked the box in that safe; but, notwithstanding
the precaution, it has been stolen.”</p>

<p>‘“The box?” I asked.</p>

<p>‘“No; the treaty only.”</p>

<p>‘“When did you make that discovery?”</p>

<p>‘“This morning.”</p>

<p>‘“At what time?”</p>

<p>‘“Soon after eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>‘He did not proceed to give me all the particulars in
narrative form, as another person might have done, but I
had to drag them from him, so to speak, by question and
answer.</p>

<p>‘“Where did the courier come from, Prince?” I asked.</p>

<p>‘“Bulgaria.”</p>

<p>‘“Was he aware of the importance of the despatches
he carried?”</p>

<p>‘“Certainly.”</p>

<p>‘“You don’t doubt his honesty, I suppose?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>‘“I don’t see the slightest reason for doing so. He is
one of the best men in the service.”</p>

<p>‘“Has he been here since?”</p>

<p>‘“No. He was excessively fatigued with his long and
trying journey, and being relieved of his responsibility, he
said he should sleep for the next twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>‘“I suppose you have caused a search to be made?”</p>

<p>‘“No,” answered the Prince, with great decisiveness;
“what was the use of doing that? The thief who steals
a State document of that kind is not likely to leave much
trace behind.”</p>

<p>‘“Of course a good many persons have access to your
establishment?”</p>

<p>‘“Yes—that is, to the business part of the establishment;
but my official residence is private; and this bureau is
sacred to myself; no one but very privileged people can
enter here.”</p>

<p>‘“Do you suspect anyone?”</p>

<p>‘“No. It’s a mystery.”</p>

<p>‘“But is it clear that, whoever the person is, he must
have been well acquainted with this place?”</p>

<p>‘“Yes,” answered the Prince thoughtfully, as he stroked
his chin.</p>

<p>‘“He must also have known that the draft had been
delivered to you?”</p>

<p>‘“True, true,” the Minister responded, with increased
thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>‘“That argues that he was behind the scenes; he knew
a good deal of what was going on, and was particularly
well acquainted with the importance of the treaty.”</p>

<p>‘“Obviously.”</p>

<p>‘“And the document has been stolen for political
purposes?”</p>

<p>‘“Obviously, again.”</p>

<p>‘“Or the thief, being a traitor to his country, if he
belongs to this country, was actuated by mercenary motives
only, and stole the draft to sell it to our enemies?”</p>

<p>‘The Prince fixed his eye upon me again, and answered
very slowly, and with emphasis on every word:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>‘“It might be so—perhaps it is so.”</p>

<p>‘“Very well,” I said. “Now, Prince, I must ask you to
let your mind dwell upon everyone in touch with you, and
tell me if there is a single one of them against whom you
might justifiably entertain some suspicion.”</p>

<p>‘“There is no one,” he answered, after a thoughtful
pause.</p>

<p>‘“And yet an utter stranger to the place could hardly
have committed such a theft?” I suggested.</p>

<p>‘“That seems a feasible theory.”</p>

<p>‘“You’ve no reason to suppose, Prince,” I asked, “that
the despatch-box was opened on the bare chance of its containing
something of value?”</p>

<p>‘“No. My deliberate opinion is the thief wanted that
draft, and that alone. He is an enemy—a traitor; and
if he can be identified the penalty of his crime will be
death.”</p>

<p>‘“If your opinion is right, the thief, of course, must
have known the draft of the treaty was there?”</p>

<p>‘“Quite so.”</p>

<p>‘“Who was likely to have known it, do you think?”</p>

<p>‘Another long pause ensued before the Prince answered.
Then he said:</p>

<p>‘“Legitimately, very few indeed. It is one of the State
secrets. There are many people who come and go here,
and an alert traitor might learn much. I see no sign to
guide me. Clearly enough, the thief must have been in
possession of certain information supposed to be known
to this bureau alone, and he has availed himself of the
knowledge to purloin a document of extraordinary political
importance. Heaven and earth will have to be moved to
stop the thief leaving the country; but, what is of more
consequence, he must be prevented sending the document
away, or any abstract of it.”</p>

<p>‘“That is easily said,” I remarked, with a smile, for he
seemed to me to be underrating the difficulties of the
case.</p>

<p>‘“And it must be done,” came from him in a tone so
commanding, so authoritative, so decisive, that it revealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the man in his true character. Moreover, his face wore a
look of iron determination, and his eyes appeared to glow
with a strange, almost unnatural, light. After a pause, he
added: “You have the resources of an empire behind you—a
well-organized police force, an army of spies, the
telegraph system. These things, added to your own skill,
should enable you to bring the miscreant to justice, and
save the State secret from passing to our enemies.”</p>

<p>‘He spoke with a great deal of subdued force, and I
could see that his mental anxiety was painful; and yet
there was an outward semblance of calm. The extraordinary
power of self-subjection which the man possessed
enabled him to almost entirely hide the nervous excitement
which would have entirely overcome any ordinary
man.</p>

<p>‘The situation was certainly a singularly trying one; for
here was a responsible minister of the Crown, who, being
entrusted with a State document of stupendous importance,
had to confess to its having been stolen within twenty-four
hours of its coming into his possession. There appeared
to have been great carelessness somewhere, and I could see
that the Prince was terribly anxious, in spite of his self-possession.</p>

<p>‘“You say that the document was delivered to you
yesterday afternoon, Prince?” I remarked, for I found it
necessary to still question, in order to make clear certain
points which were very necessary for my own guidance,
and his natural reticence kept him from giving me every
detail right off.</p>

<p>‘“Yes,” he answered shortly, as though he considered
the question superfluous, for he had already told me what
I now wanted repeating, but I intended that the question
should lead up to others.</p>

<p>‘“How long did the courier remain with you after he
had delivered the papers into your hands?”</p>

<p>‘“Not more than five minutes.”</p>

<p>‘“When he left did anyone else come into your
bureau?”</p>

<p>‘“No.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>‘“You perused the document, of course?”</p>

<p>‘“I did. And to-day it was to have been laid before
his Majesty the Emperor.”</p>

<p>‘“How long did you remain here after the departure of
your courier?”</p>

<p>‘“An hour.”</p>

<p>‘“And you are sure nobody came in during that
time?”</p>

<p>‘“Absolutely certain.”</p>

<p>‘“And are you as certain, Prince, that nobody was concealed
in the room without your knowing it?”</p>

<p>‘The question seemed to startle him, but in an instant
he controlled himself again, and, with a cold smile, remarked,
as he glanced round the room:</p>

<p>‘“I am quite as certain. You can see for yourself
that there is no place where a person could conceal himself.”</p>

<p>‘I had to admit that that was so.</p>

<p>‘“If I have not misunderstood you,” I went on, “when
you had perused the document, you placed it in the
despatch-box?”</p>

<p>‘“I did. Both safe and box were afterwards locked.
I locked them myself, and took the keys with me.”</p>

<p>‘“When did you discover the loss?”</p>

<p>‘“About an hour and a half ago.”</p>

<p>‘“Had the lock of the safe been tampered with?”</p>

<p>‘“Not at all.”</p>

<p>‘“It was intact?”</p>

<p>‘“Certainly.”</p>

<p>‘“And the despatch-box?”</p>

<p>‘“That was intact also.”</p>

<p>‘“Then, both safe and box must have been opened with
keys that fitted them?”</p>

<p>‘“That is obvious.”</p>

<p>‘“Are there any duplicate keys in existence?”</p>

<p>‘“Yes; there are duplicate keys of all the despatch-boxes
and all the safes in this department, but they are in
possession of the Emperor himself. They are kept to
guard against any possible contingency.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>‘“But presumably it would be very difficult for any
unauthorized person to obtain possession of them?”</p>

<p>‘“I should say that the difficulties in the way are so
great that we may dismiss it as being practically impossible.”</p>

<p>‘“That throws us back, then, on the theory that somebody
must have got possession of your keys.”</p>

<p>‘“There, again, the difficulties are so great that I cannot
think it possible. Come with me, and I will show you the
safeguards that are adopted.”</p>

<p>‘I followed him out of the room. At the door of his
bureau was an armed sentry. We traversed a long corridor.
On each side were doors. At the end of the
corridor another sentry was posted. We gained a large
square hall, where several liveried servants stood. Two
came forward, and partly drew aside the massive velvet
curtains hung before the marble stairs; these stairs were
covered with massive carpet, into which the feet sank.</p>

<p>‘On the landings more liveried servants were posted.
We passed along a carpeted passage to the Prince’s official
residence, and entered a magnificent room, and thence into
a luxuriously furnished boudoir, where a lady sat alone,
perusing a book. For a moment she did not notice me,
as I was some little distance behind the Prince, and partly
screened by the velvet portière at the door. She jumped
up, and was about to throw her arms around his neck, but
catching sight of me, she blushed, drew back, and said to
him:</p>

<p>‘“I did not expect you so soon.”</p>

<p>‘“I am engaged on some important business, Catarina,”
he replied, a little brusquely. “You had better retire for
a time.”</p>

<p>‘Without another word she withdrew. She was a young
woman, about four or five-and-twenty, and one of the few
I have seen whose beauty might be said to be without
blemish. Complexion, features, eyes, teeth, lips, hair—the
whole figure was perfect. She was ravishing—a
woman for whom a man would have perilled his soul.</p>

<p>‘From the boudoir we entered a spacious and magnificently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
arranged and furnished sleeping apartment. In
one corner was a large cupboard. The Prince drew a
peculiarly constructed key from his pocket, opened the
door, and flung it back, remarking as he did so:</p>

<p>‘“That door is of steel. In that niche in the cupboard
all my keys are deposited every night. The door is then
secured, and the key of the door, together with many
other keys, are given into the charge of the confidential
clerk, Vladimir Nicolayeff. He is an institution here,
and has been in the Government service upwards of forty
years.”</p>

<p>‘“Does he reside on the premises?” I asked the Prince.</p>

<p>‘“He does,” was the answer; “and you will now see
how difficult it is, with all these precautions, for anyone
to abstract the keys.”</p>

<p>‘In answer to this, I could not refrain from remarking:</p>

<p>‘“And yet, Prince, there is the hard fact that your safe
and despatch-box have been opened, and a State document
stolen.”</p>

<p>‘He looked very thoughtful and grave as he replied
somewhat sternly:</p>

<p>‘“That is so. And what you have got to do is to
endeavour to find out how they have been opened, who
opened them, and where the papers have gone to. Please
commence your work at once, as every hour’s delay is in
favour of the thief.”</p>

<p>‘“You must pardon me, Prince,” I remarked; “but I
have a few more questions to ask, and you must allow me
to work in my own way.”</p>

<p>‘“Oh, certainly!” he exclaimed, a little peevishly, which
somewhat astonished me, having regard to the way he had
controlled himself so far; but it was another indication of
the anxiety that was consuming him.</p>

<p>‘Nor was it to be wondered at, for he himself had hinted
that if this State secret was made known to the enemies of
Russia it was quite within the bounds of possibility that
war might ensue.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>‘No man, much less the Prince, could have been indifferent
to that, for it was an open political secret that
Russia at that moment was far from being in a fit condition
to take the field against a powerful foe. The signs
of the times pointed to a coming conflict at no distant
date, and fully aware of that, it was known, or believed,
that the Prince, who was intensely patriotic, intensely
ambitious, and no less intensely desirous of enormously
expanding the Czar’s dominions, had been making herculean
efforts to consolidate the Empire, and gain the
allegiance, or at least the neutrality, of certain States,
without which Russia’s aims might, and in all probability
would, be frustrated. Bearing all this in mind, the reader
will be at no loss to understand how a man like the Prince
would be distressed by the danger which confronted him;
for if anyone did know, he certainly did, that the internal
weakness of Russia was too great just then for a responsible
Minister to risk a great war.</p>

<p>‘By further questioning the Prince, I ascertained that
he had a private and confidential secretary, in addition to
twelve ordinary secretaries. But not one of them was
admitted to the private bureau, where for the time being
the State papers were deposited, without the Prince’s permission.
His official business was transacted in another
department, and the inner sanctum sanctorum was in a
measure sacred to the Prince himself. A sentry was always
posted at the door, and he had strict orders to allow no
one to enter who had not special business, and who was not
furnished with a pass.</p>

<p>‘Being hedged round with these precautions, it seemed
very difficult to comprehend how anyone could have gained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
access to the room in order to obtain possession of the
precious documents. In constructing a theory, there were
many points that could not possibly be overlooked. The
chief of them was the all but absolute certainty that there
had been a conspiracy, and a traitor and a spy was in the
camp. He had known of the negotiations that were going
on with respect to the treaty; he knew that the special
courier was travelling post-haste to Russia; that the draft
was delivered into the Prince’s hands, and deposited temporarily
in the Prince’s safe, where all documents relating
to the Prince’s department—that is, political documents—requiring
the Foreign Minister’s close personal attention
were placed for his convenience.</p>

<p>‘In the case of a document of such paramount importance
as this secret treaty, no copy of it could be made at
first. This was another point the thief was obviously
aware of, and it was also certain that he must have been
pressed for time, or he would have made a copy of the
draft himself, or extracts from it, which it was presumable
might have answered all the purposes for which the document
had been stolen. Such a course would not only have
prevented the hue and cry being raised, but all the resources
of a great Empire being put in motion against
him.</p>

<p>‘Examining the matter in this light, the question
necessarily arose, Who was there who, having access to the
Foreign Office, was enabled, in spite of all the stringent
regulations and safeguards, to penetrate to the very centre
of the temple—if one may use such an expression—and
carry off a secret which was known to comparatively few
people?</p>

<p>‘This question was, of course, the crux of the whole
affair, but I felt satisfied in my own mind about one thing.
The guilty person was someone who knew the working of
the Foreign Office, was well acquainted with the internal
arrangements, and in close contact with the Prince. It
need scarcely be said, perhaps, that the Prince was exceedingly
anxious to prevent the matter leaking out and
becoming public property. It would necessarily have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
caused great excitement and grave anxiety, and I agreed
with him that on many grounds it was highly desirable to
keep it from the public.</p>

<p>‘There was one other point I ought to refer to, and it
is a very important one; the theft was clearly committed
during the night, or, at any rate, after business hours.
On the first view that might seem to narrow the inquiry
somewhat, though, as a matter of fact, it presented the
affair in a more complex aspect; but, on the other hand,
it seemed to me to point conclusively to several persons
being concerned.</p>

<p>‘In setting to work to read the riddle, I proceeded on
the analytical principle, and searched, to begin with, for
the motive. That seemed very apparent. Firstly, it was
a secret treaty; secondly, it was framed against Turkey;
thirdly, it was conceivable that it was of vital importance
to Turkey to know what the treaty was likely to do, what
it aimed at; therefore, somebody in the pay of Turkey,
or somebody as a speculation, had stolen the document
with a view to pecuniary gain.</p>

<p>‘The latter supposition seemed to me hardly tenable—at
any rate, not so likely as the idea that Turkey had her
spies even in the Russian Foreign Office. I don’t mean to
say these spies were Turks themselves. As can be understood,
it would have been next to impossible for a Turk to
have gained entrance to the Foreign Office; but Turkey,
of course, had her emissaries, and Russians were to be
found so debased, so dead to all patriotism, so lost to
every sense of honour, so mercenary, that they were ready
to sell their country for the gain of gold. Of course,
black sheep of this kind are numbered in every nation,
therefore Russia was no exception.</p>

<p>‘Everything pointed to the thief being a Russian, and,
being a Russian, he also had some connection with the
Foreign Office, a connection which gave him the right of
being under the roof all night.</p>

<p>‘It is necessary to explain that the Foreign Minister in
Russia is provided with an official residence in the Foreign
Office itself; that is to say, a portion of the actual building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
is set apart for the accommodation of himself and family
and suite. An official of this kind keeps up a great deal
more state than an English Minister does, and his suite
and servants are generally very numerous.</p>

<p>‘In the Prince’s case, there were fewer people about him
than usual, for the reason that he had no family. Nevertheless,
I found that, including footmen, pages, and lower
servants, there were forty persons in his <i>ménage</i>, and his
domestic affairs were attended to and presided over by the
lady whom he had addressed as Catarina, and whose ravishing
beauty had so struck me. It is not necessary to refer
to her by any other name. This lady had two private
maids, and she exercised very considerable influence over
the Prince’s personal and domestic affairs.</p>

<p>‘At this stage of my theorizing it seemed to me very
clear that the miscreant would be found amongst the personnel
of the Prince. The consideration of all the facts
forced me to this, the most feasible conclusion. But I
did not lose sight of the almost absolute certainty of a
conspiracy, because it was hardly conceivable that one
person, and one person only, would have committed such
a daring act of treason; for an act of that kind was very
foul treason indeed, and in Russia was punishable with
death.</p>

<p>‘Assuming that I was right with regard to my surmises,
it would seem that a member of the household had been
tampered with; pressure and temptation had been brought
to bear upon him from outside. The temptation must
have been great; heavy payment would be made; the
traitor had been willing to sell his country for blood-money,
and I was at pains to try and ascertain if any
member of the Prince’s <i>personnel</i> had given indications of
being in possession of an unusual amount of money.</p>

<p>‘I have endeavoured so far to make clear to those who
may read this narrative the mental process by which I
tried to lay hold of a clue. I need scarcely say that at
the outset in a case of this kind one gropes in the dark.
There is not a ray of light at first to guide him, and he
must proceed cautiously and warily lest he go astray, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
while he is straining his eyes in one direction, his quarry is
safely flying in another. Seeming impossibilities have to
be reconciled with probabilities, and probabilities reduced
to certainties. And when a clue, no matter how faint,
has once been struck, it must be followed up patiently,
intelligibly, and doggedly. There are three golden rules
to be strictly observed by him who would succeed in connecting
crime with its author. They are patience, silence,
watchfulness.</p>

<p>‘Human craft and human cunning are very difficult things
to deal with, nor can one deal with them at all unless he is
deeply read in human nature. In this instance craft of no
ordinary kind had to be encountered. The criminal, to
begin with, was not of the ordinary type. It was probable
that up to this time he had lived a seeming virtuous life,
and knowing how terrible was the penalty attaching to his
wrong-doing, he would strain every nerve to prevent suspicion
falling upon him. I had necessarily to consider all
these little details, for they were essential to success.</p>

<p>‘Although the Prince bore the reputation of being a cool,
calculating diplomatist, who had outwitted every other
diplomatist in Europe with whom he had had dealings, I
found that in this matter of the stolen treaty he somewhat
discredited his reputation; for he was by no means cool,
and seemed unable to enter into the calculations which
were necessary to a clear understanding of the course to be
pursued if the mystery was to be unravelled. He had at
the outset reminded me that I had the resources of an
empire at my command, and he insisted on the telegraph
being set instantly to work, and the police throughout the
country being placed in possession of the facts. I was
opposed to that course myself; I thought it was as likely as
not to frustrate our efforts. But, of course, he had his own
way, and he soon began to display not only irritation, but
decided anger, when he found that I narrowed my search to
the Foreign Office, and showed no inclination to go further
afield. “It seems to me,” he cried warmly, “that you are
simply wasting time, and giving the enemy a chance. While
you are hanging about here the traitor is making good his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
escape. Is it not certain that, whoever it is who stole the
document, he is now hurrying to Turkey with it as fast as
he can?”</p>

<p>‘“No, Prince,” I replied; “it is by no means certain that
such is the case. On the contrary, I incline very strongly
indeed to the belief that the traitor will be found here
under this roof; that he has not stirred away, and is not
likely to stir away.”</p>

<p>‘“You are wrong,” he said sharply.</p>

<p>‘“We shall see,” I answered. “I admit that it is highly
probable the document is being conveyed to the Turkish
Government. If that is so, we cannot hope to overtake it,
and another move will have to be made on the diplomatic
board in order to checkmate those who have circumvented
you. Your splendid skill in the game will enable you to
determine the move. You may depend upon it that those
who have entered into this conspiracy to convey valuable
information to our country’s enemy have well calculated
the chances of success, and have taken means to ensure the
information reaching its destination. But the key of the
puzzle must be searched for here. If we find that key
quickly, we may be able to prevent the information reaching
the Turkish Government; but it is useless trying to do
so without the key.”</p>

<p>‘“Then, you suspect someone in the department?” the
Prince asked.</p>

<p>‘“I don’t suspect anyone at present,” I answered.</p>

<p>‘“What I mean to say is, you think the thief is one of
the employés of the Foreign Office?”</p>

<p>‘“I think the thief is a member of your own household,
Prince.”</p>

<p>‘He looked at me in astonishment; then something like
a smile of incredulity flitted across his stern face as he exclaimed,
“Oh, nonsense!”</p>

<p>‘“Why do you think it nonsense?” I asked.</p>

<p>‘“It seems to me simply impossible that it could be so.
No member of my household could have gained access to
the bureau.”</p>

<p>‘At this I reminded him that, whereas in the daytime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
the corridors of the Foreign Office were patrolled by
sentries, they were withdrawn when business hours closed,
though sentries were on duty all night outside.</p>

<p>‘“But all communication between my residence and the
office is shut off at night by locked doors,” he answered.</p>

<p>‘“That only serves to show how very cunning and very
clever the thief was to succeed in reaching your room and
opening the safe in spite of bolts and bars,” I said.</p>

<p>‘The Prince grew very thoughtful. He seemed greatly
struck by my theory, and ultimately confessed that he had
not seen the matter from that point of view before. The
result was he said I was to work in my own way, to follow
my own lead, and to have an absolutely free hand.</p>

<p>‘“It is a dastardly business,” he exclaimed with warmth,
“and even if the traitor were to turn out to be my own
brother, I would not hesitate to shoot him, for nothing
short of instant death would be a fitting punishment.”’</p>

<p>Of course, all the resources peculiar to the Russian police
system were utilized so far as they could be in a case of
this kind. But the difficulties in the way will at once be
apparent when it is borne in mind that the fact of a treaty
having been stolen from the Foreign Office had to be kept
as secret as possible. If the matter had leaked out, and
become generally known to the public, the excitement
would necessarily have been tremendous, and the objects
in view—that is, the capture of the thief and the recovery
of the missing document—would, in all probability, have
been frustrated.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place here to explain that in Russia
there is an armed police answering to the French gendarme;
then there is a municipal police, very similar to the police
of Great Britain; and lastly there is a vast army of spies,
or <i>mouchards</i>, as the French call them. In this army both
sexes are represented, and they overrun Russia. The three
branches of the police service are not worked and controlled
from one centre, owing to the vastness of the
country; and this want of centralization has always been
a flaw in the administration, as it is sometimes difficult to
bring the various centres into complete harmony.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>From these particulars, it will be gathered that a great
deal must depend on individual effort, for while in the
concrete the system may present weak parts and differences
that are irreconcilable, in the abstract there is a unity of
motion which gives the individual tremendous power, in
this way: An accredited Government agent moving from
point to point could demand, and would receive, every
possible assistance, and the lumbering methods of the
bureaucracy would be dispensed with.</p>

<p>In our own country we often complain very bitterly
about the red-tapeism which so seriously clogs and
hampers freedom of movement. But this red-tapeism of
ours is nothing as compared with Russia. Russian red-tapeism
is responsible for tremendous evils, and it often
retards in a painful manner the administration of
justice.</p>

<p>It will now be clear, probably, to the mind of the
reader that an individual in Russia, endowed with
faculties beyond the ordinary, has a chance of very
signally distinguishing himself. This was certainly the
case with Danevitch; and while nominally he was under
the control and subject to the authorities in St. Petersburg,
he was allowed a latitude and a freedom of action
accorded to but few. His peculiar talents and his
individuality begot him this distinction, and while it
placed great responsibility on him, it left him so far
untrammelled that he was enabled to exercise his independent
judgment, and pursue the course which seemed to
him, according to the circumstances of the hour, the right
one.</p>

<p>After all, this was but another illustration of the fact
that nothing succeeds like success. Danevitch had been
singularly successful, though his success was due to talents
only one remove from genius.</p>

<p>He has already, in his own words, made it plain that,
in the case of the missing treaty, he believed, and in fact
felt certain, that the culprit would be found amongst the
Prince’s household, though this did not prevent him availing
himself of all the resources of the police department,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
which of course he had a right to do. But necessarily he
was hampered by the secrecy it was so important to
observe. What he did was to request by telegraph that
the authorities in all the principal towns, seaports, and
frontier stations should issue orders for a more than
ordinarily strict examination of the passports and papers
of people passing out of the country; that every person
from St. Petersburg should be closely questioned, and
should suspicion be aroused by his answers, he should be
detained, and his luggage searched.</p>

<p>This is a measure permissible in Russia, but would not
be tolerated in England. But in the vast dominion over
which the Czar rules it is a necessity, and through its
means many a crime has been detected and many a plot
frustrated. It is right to say that the seizure of luggage
is only resorted to when there is strong reason for believing
that the owner is a dangerous person.</p>

<p>Although Danevitch took the steps indicated, he did not
believe for a moment that anything would result beyond a
great number of people being seriously inconvenienced,
some innocent persons being arrested, and a great deal of
blundering on the part of jacks in office, and of boorishness
on the part of local police, who, dressed in a little brief
authority, like to exercise it with all the brutal brusqueness
peculiar to ignorant minds. He relied upon his own
methods, and felt convinced that, if the mystery was ever
to be unravelled, it could only be done by his own individual
efforts. The more he dwelt upon all the details of the
case as he had gathered them, the more he was convinced
the guilty person would be found to be somebody who was
in close communication with the Prince. Working on
this basis, he classified the household under three heads
for the purpose of giving his theory a somewhat practical
form:</p>

<p>Firstly, there were the lower servants of the <i>ménage</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, the upper servants.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the body servants of the Prince and his close
personal attendants, including his secretaries, clerks, shorthand-writers,
and amanuenses.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>Those in the first category he dismissed from his calculations
altogether, since it was so highly improbable that any
one of them could have had the opportunities for committing
such a crime. Obviously, in an establishment so
constituted as the official residence of the Prince was, an
inferior servant could not have gained access to the Prince’s
private rooms without running the gauntlet of many
vigilant eyes, and incurring so much risk as to make it all
but impossible that he could succeed.</p>

<p>Those who fell into the second category were not passed
over without a little more consideration and a critical
examination of the possibilities which were presented, when
they were weighed individually and collectively. But
when all this had been done, Danevitch scored them off
the slate, too, and the sphere of his inquiry was so far
narrowed.</p>

<p>In the third category there were necessarily included
persons of intelligence which ranked higher than that to
be found in the other two. But, as Danevitch progressed
with the working out of his theory, he deemed it important
to subdivide this third category, because his investigations
made it clear that only a few of these individuals
were so situated as to have the chance of abstracting the
document.</p>

<p>Let it be distinctly borne in mind that the paper was in
a despatch-box, locked. The despatch-box was in a safe,
locked. The safe was in the Prince’s private bureau,
where none but the privileged were allowed to enter, and
the door of which was also locked. Now, then, let it be
still further remembered that the keys necessary to open the
door of the safe and the despatch-box were kept in a safe
in the Prince’s bedroom, and the key of that safe was one
of a number which every night were given into the custody
of Vladimir Nicolayeff, the Clerk of the Keys.</p>

<p>There was another point which had to be very closely
considered. It was this: the person who stole the document
must have known it was there. He could not have
known it was there if he had not occupied a position
which enabled him to learn a good deal of what was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
on; but as it could not be supposed for a moment that a
Minister like the Prince would have lightly made a confidant
of an inferior and irresponsible person, it was difficult
to believe that the crime was the work of one individual;
and here again Danevitch had to build up a theory, which
he did as follows:</p>

<p>A was in possession of a secret that a draft treaty was
being conveyed from Bulgaria to Russia, and would reach
the Prince at a certain hour on a certain day, and for
political or mercenary motives imparted the information to
B, who, probably for political motives only, wished to
make it known to the Government of the country against
which the treaty was framed. B had to fall back upon C
to procure the keys, without which the documents could
not be carried off.</p>

<p>Here at once a conspiracy was suggested, and, a conspiracy
admitted, it was impossible to dismiss the courier
and Vladimir Nicolayeff from it. These two men, of
course, represented extremes of position. The courier,
whose name was Boruff, was a trusted and confidential
Government officer of good birth and high social position.
Nicolayeff, on the other hand, was a porter—a trusted
servant, it was true, but a servant of humble origin and
low rank. His services, if they had been given and used,
must have been bought; that is, he had been corrupted,
tempted from his allegiance by money. Next, the third
or middle person had to be considered. What position
did he occupy? It was not easy to answer that beyond
saying it was obviously someone very close to the
Prince.</p>

<p>Having arranged these various points, and set them
forth in their order, he felt satisfied that his theory was
a feasible one, and, if acted upon, was more likely to yield
results than the search-for-the-needle-in-the-bottle-of-hay
process of stopping people at the frontiers. At any rate,
while that process was being carried out, Danevitch proceeded
on his own lines, and his first step was directed to
learning some particulars about Boruff.</p>

<p>In age the courier verged on forty. He had been in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Government service for fifteen years. Every confidence
was reposed in him, and he was greatly respected. He
had been engaged on courier duty for something like
four years, and had made many journeys between Turkey
and Russia. Formerly he had been a confidential clerk at
the Russian Consulate at Smyrna.</p>

<p>He was a married man, and had four children, but lived
apart from his family. There had been serious disagreements
between him and his wife, owing, so it was stated,
to his infatuation for another lady, which had led to
all sorts of complications, difficulties, and domestic jars.
These, of course, were purely family matters, and had not
affected his Government position, as it was considered there
were faults on both sides. Boruff was not well off. Such
officials are poorly paid in Russia; and as he was forced to
keep up two establishments, and moreover was extravagant,
his resources were severely taxed.</p>

<p>So much did Danevitch learn of Boruff. Not much, if
anything at all, to suggest a probability that Boruff had
any guilty knowledge. He was a poor man; that was the
worst that could be said about him. But poverty lays a
man open to many temptations. Starving virtue is sorely
tested when gold is jingled in its ears. It is so easy to be
honest when one wants for nothing.</p>

<p>Such were Danevitch’s reflections, and he put Boruff in
his note-book, as he says, for future use if necessary. He
thought it was just possible that ultimately the courier
would prove one of the pieces necessary to complete the
puzzle.</p>

<p>He next turned his attention to Vladimir Nicolayeff, a
man of a totally different stamp. He was an old man—well,
that is, he was close on sixty. He had been in the
army, and had seen service in his youth, but, having been
severely wounded, was discharged, and ultimately got employment
under the Government. He had served at the
Foreign Office a great many years. His position, though
humble, was an important one. In his lodge in the
entrance-hall all the keys not in use were kept. He also
received messages and parcels, answered questions of inquirers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and pointed out the way to the different departments.</p>

<p>At this stage Danevitch sought another interview with
the Prince, who cast a quick, keen glance at the detective,
and asked curtly:</p>

<p>‘What news?’</p>

<p>‘None,’ was the equally curt answer.</p>

<p>‘Have you entirely failed?’ asked the Prince.</p>

<p>‘At present I can say nothing.’</p>

<p>‘But you have got no clue?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>A look of annoyance swept across the face of the Prince,
and he shrugged his shoulders, as if in disgust.</p>

<p>‘I suppose it is hopeless now to expect any results from
your inquiries?’</p>

<p>‘You forget, Prince,’ said Danevitch, with dignity, ‘it is
not many hours since you instructed me in the matter. I
cannot perform impossibilities.’</p>

<p>‘True, true,’ was the irritable response. ‘But tell me,
do you see any likelihood of being able to bring the guilt
home to anyone?’</p>

<p>‘Excuse me, Prince,’ answered Danevitch firmly, ‘I am
not given to expressing ill-formed opinions, and, not being
a prophet, I decline to run the risk of prophesying.’</p>

<p>‘Forgive me,’ said the Prince; ‘I am afraid I have
allowed my anxiety to blind me to common-sense. But
the fact is, this loss has preyed upon my mind terribly.
It is a very serious affair indeed—very serious. Moreover,
it shows that there is a traitor somewhere. If we have
traitors about, the State is in danger. Therefore it is imperative
that this matter should be sifted to the very
bottom. No time, no money, no patience, no skill, must
be spared. The truth will have to be revealed.’</p>

<p>‘I would venture to remind you, Prince,’ said Danevitch,
‘that the virtue of patience is one which, above all others,
should be exercised in a case of this kind.’</p>

<p>The Prince was not indifferent to the point of the
remark, and, bowing with consummate politeness, said:</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, Danevitch; I have perhaps been hasty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
You understand your art better than I do. I have no
right to dictate to you. Pray proceed on your own
lines.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ Danevitch replied. ‘We shall get on now.
My object in requesting this interview is to ask who conveys
your keys to Nicolayeff at night?’</p>

<p>‘No one. It is his duty to come to me and receive
them. But as it often happens that it is not convenient
for me to see him myself, the keys are then given to him
by my valet—a fine youth named André.’</p>

<p>‘Did André give them to him the night before last,
when the papers were stolen?’</p>

<p>‘No; I gave him the keys myself.’</p>

<p>‘There is no mistake about that, Prince?’</p>

<p>‘None whatever.’</p>

<p>‘One more question: Did you go out that night?’</p>

<p>‘I did. I went to the opera.’</p>

<p>‘What time did you return?’</p>

<p>‘About two in the morning.’</p>

<p>‘Did you note if the door of the safe in your sleeping
apartment was closed then?’</p>

<p>‘I haven’t a doubt about it.’</p>

<p>‘But you didn’t try the door?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Were the keys in their proper places in the morning?’</p>

<p>The Prince did not answer immediately. He appeared
to be reflecting. At last he said:</p>

<p>‘Yes, of course they were. I remember now taking
them out of the safe myself, and handing them to my
private secretary, who proceeded with me to my bureau.
There is one point I forgot to tell you at our last interview.
When I opened the safe in the bureau, I noticed that the
lid of the despatch-box was wide open. It was that that
aroused my suspicions, and led to my discovering immediately
that the papers had gone.’</p>

<p>‘But the despatch-box had been locked overnight?’</p>

<p>‘I am certain of it.’</p>

<p>‘So that the thief must have forgotten to close it again
after abstracting the papers.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>‘Precisely so.’</p>

<p>After this interview, Danevitch felt more than ever convinced
that someone in very close personal relations with
the Prince had been a party to the deed, and began to look
round to see if suspicion could be justifiably entertained
against any one of the inner household, so to speak. With
a view to this end, he arranged the following plan with the
Prince. He was to spend two days at the official residence
in the character of a foreign visitor—the Prince’s guest.
André, the valet, was to be told off to personally attend
him.</p>

<p>In due course Danevitch arrived. He was driven to the
residence in one of the Prince’s carriages, which was sent
to the station to meet him. He had a certain amount of
luggage, which was deposited in the handsome bed-chamber
allotted to him. He was a German on a secret mission,
and did not understand Russian. His get-up would have
deceived his own mother. He found André a smart,
intelligent young man, who seemed to wear his heart upon
his sleeve. There was nothing whatever in his manner or
bearing which caused Danevitch to mistrust him.</p>

<p>The beautiful Catarina presided over the Prince’s household,
but never sat at his table. The detective was a little
puzzled at first to understand the reason of that; and, in
fact, Catarina was a kind of mystery, but in a few hours
he had defined her position. Ostensibly she was his ward.
She was the daughter of a very old friend of his, a military
man, who had been killed on active service, and, in accordance
with a solemn compact made between the two
men, the Prince undertook to be a father to the orphan
daughter. That was the story generally believed; at any
rate, people affected to believe it. Danevitch did not. He
found that Catarina had great influence over the Prince at
times; but at others he seemed to treat her with coldness,
even disdain, according to his mood. Danevitch came to
the conclusion that Catarina was, in her way, almost as
much a diplomatist as the Prince himself; but he saw
signs—trifling ones, but significant to him—that whatever
love or affection there was was on the Prince’s side. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
was sure that Catarina was not happy, but led a lonely,
fretting life in that splendid palace.</p>

<p>Danevitch went for two days, but his visit was extended
to a week. When he was taking his departure, the Prince
asked him if he was any wiser than when he went.</p>

<p>‘A little,’ answered Danevitch.</p>

<p>‘But is there anybody in my household whom you
suspect?’ asked the Prince with some anxiety.</p>

<p>‘Frankly there is,’ said the detective.</p>

<p>‘Who is it?’ the Minister demanded in a peremptory
tone.</p>

<p>‘Pardon me,’ said Danevitch, ‘for declining to answer
you now. But unless I am very much mistaken, I shall be
able to give you some valuable information before many
days have passed.’</p>

<p>In less than a week Danevitch sought another interview
with the Prince.</p>

<p>‘I have a request to prefer this time,’ said Danevitch
after some preliminary remarks.</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ asked the Minister quickly, and possibly
reading in his visitor’s face that he had made a discovery.</p>

<p>‘You have a daughter?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ gasped the Prince, who, in spite of his power of
self-control, started at the question, and his brow clouded
over.</p>

<p>‘She is the wife of Kasin, who is the Russian Consul at
Smyrna.’</p>

<p>A cold, cynical smile of bitterness played about the
Prince’s thin lips as he remarked:</p>

<p>‘That is an open secret. But let me tell you at once,
I have not seen my daughter for years, and never wish to
see her again. She is an ingrate. I have cast her forth
from my heart.’</p>

<p>The Prince betrayed the fact that, though he bore the
reputation of being a man of blood and iron, and very
likely justified his reputation when it came to matters of
diplomacy, he had hidden springs of deep emotion and
passion which were capable of being called into play.</p>

<p>‘I do not wish to probe you, sir, nor touch upon your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
domestic affairs more than can possibly be helped. I have
come here to request that you will influence the recall of
your son-in-law from Smyrna.’</p>

<p>The Prince sprang to his feet, and grasped the back of
his chair, and though he tried to control himself, it was
evident he was greatly excited.</p>

<p>‘Good God!’ he exclaimed, ‘do you mean to say that
my son-in-law has had a hand in this business?’</p>

<p>‘I mean to say nothing, sir, at present.’</p>

<p>‘But your request carries with it an accusation. Remember
the terrible responsibility of that. If Kasin has
had a hand in purloining these papers he is a traitor, and
the penalty is death.’</p>

<p>‘I am aware of that, Prince.’</p>

<p>‘The disgrace to me would be terrible. I hate him,
but he is my son-in-law.’</p>

<p>The Prince paced up and down the room. He was
strongly agitated. His pride was wounded, perhaps, as it
had never been wounded before. Danevitch remained
silent. He had nothing more to say then. Presently the
Prince swung round on his heel, and said sternly, and
threateningly:</p>

<p>‘Remember this, Danevitch, not only is your own reputation
at stake, but the honour of my family. You may
risk your reputation as much as you like—it is naught to
me; but, by the Virgin! be careful of my honour, or——’</p>

<p>He suddenly checked himself. Danevitch rose, and,
with a cold bow, remarked:</p>

<p>‘I will withdraw from this business altogether. What
I have learnt shall be a locked secret with me. I wish you
good-day, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Stay!’ cried the Prince. ‘I apologize to you. I
forgot myself, but make allowance for my feelings. I am
in the wrong; you are in the right. Forgive me. This
matter must go through, let the consequences be what
they may. Though my daughter, my own flesh and blood,
be guilty of this crime, she shall suffer. My country—Russia’s
interests have the first claim upon me. Pray
proceed. I was the father a few minutes ago. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Prince Ignatof, Russia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs,
again.’</p>

<p>He resumed his seat. He was the calm, cold, passionless,
unemotional diplomatist once more.</p>

<p>‘Now, then, tell me all,’ he said peremptorily.</p>

<p>‘At this hour I have nothing to tell you. I am here to
prefer a request. That I have a motive in making that
request, you may take for granted.’</p>

<p>‘You want Kasin to be recalled?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘It shall be done.’</p>

<p>‘When? Immediately.’</p>

<p>‘Is it so urgent as that?’</p>

<p>‘It is.’</p>

<p>‘Good. He shall be recalled by telegraph.’</p>

<p>‘I would request that he be commanded to leave Turkish
soil in twelve hours’ time, and to telegraph as soon as he
is in Russia.’</p>

<p>‘And after that?’</p>

<p>‘And after that I will make a revelation to you.’</p>

<p>‘So be it. In three days’ time, call here again at this
hour. You will find me alone, and prepared to receive
your revelation.’</p>

<p>Danevitch took his departure. That same evening
Vladimir Nicolayeff was walking along one of the principal
streets. He had been dining at a café, and was making
his way back to his duties at the Foreign Office. A
bearded man suddenly confronted him at a corner of a
street, and said:</p>

<p>‘Nicolayeff, what was your reward for being false to
your trust?’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ demanded the porter angrily.</p>

<p>‘Why do you answer my question with another? I
ask how much were you paid for being false to your
trust?’</p>

<p>Nicolayeff was agitated and confused.</p>

<p>‘Who are you?’ he demanded.</p>

<p>‘The devil.’</p>

<p>‘Then, betake yourself to your kingdom.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>‘Not until I have done with you here. Again I ask
you how much were you paid for giving up the key of
Prince Ignatof’s safe to the beautiful Catarina? Or was
it her beauty alone that tempted you?’</p>

<p>Nicolayeff reeled. It almost seemed as if he was suddenly
seized with palsy, and he uttered a strange, half-choked
cry as he sank to the ground in a swoon. Perhaps
in his superstitious mind he really thought the bearded
man was the Evil One. A policeman approached. The
bearded man whispered something in his ear and disappeared.
The policeman blew a whistle, and assistance
came. Then Nicolayeff was carried to the station, and
when he recovered from the swoon he found himself a
prisoner. In the meantime a message had been sent to
the Foreign Office to say that the Clerk of the Keys had
been picked up in the street in a swoon, and was then in
custody. The message was conveyed direct to the Prince.</p>

<p>Three days passed, and Danevitch again presented himself
at the Prince’s bureau.</p>

<p>‘Have you any news, Prince?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘A code telegram was sent to Kasin recalling him.’</p>

<p>‘Is he in Russia?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. He has not answered.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, I suspected that would be the case.’</p>

<p>‘I await your revelation,’ said the Prince calmly.</p>

<p>‘It is here,’ answered Danevitch, as he took a letter
from his pocket-book and handed it to the Prince. ‘Shall
I retire while you read it?’</p>

<p>The Prince glanced at the handwriting, and became
very agitated.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he said, ‘do. Come back in a quarter of an
hour.’</p>

<p>As Danevitch went out, the Minister called to the sentry
at the door:</p>

<p>‘He will return in fifteen minutes. In the meantime
let no one else enter at your peril.’</p>

<p>When Danevitch went back, he found the Prince seated
at his desk. His face was almost deathly in its whiteness;
but he was calm and frigid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>‘You are deserving of your reputation,’ he said. ‘You
have indeed made a revelation. How did you obtain
possession of that letter?’</p>

<p>‘I intercepted it. The writer believes, no doubt, that
it is now on its way to Turkey.’</p>

<p>‘Nicolayeff is under arrest.’</p>

<p>‘He is.’</p>

<p>‘See that not a moment is lost in securing Boruff.’</p>

<p>‘That shall be done, Prince.’</p>

<p>‘The interview can end.’</p>

<p>‘Have you no other instructions?’ asked Danevitch
significantly.</p>

<p>The Prince understood. A pang of emotion caused his
face to twitch, and he turned away. But in a few
moments he was the cold, passionless man once more.</p>

<p>‘I have no other instructions,’ answered the Prince with
equal significance.</p>

<p>‘And the letter?’</p>

<p>‘I will keep it.’</p>

<p>Danevitch bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>The following morning, early, a closed carriage, drawn
by four superb horses, left the Foreign Offices. The occupants
of the carriage were Prince Ignatof and the beautiful
Catarina. She was elegantly attired, and looked charming;
but there was an expression of some anxiety on her face,
and when she gave certain instructions to her maid, who
was to sit with the driver, there was a tremulousness in
her tone which was not natural to her.</p>

<p>The carriage was driven to one of the Prince’s country
estates on the great Moscow road. It was an old-fashioned
mansion in the midst of pine-woods, and the extensive
pine-woods round about swarmed with game, fur and
feathered. The Prince often entertained large shooting-parties
there, but on this occasion he had no guests. The
servants in charge had been apprised of his coming, and
had the mansion in readiness.</p>

<p>Two nights later a strange thing happened. The Prince
and Catarina were together in their chamber, when a shrill
scream resounded through the house. It was a woman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
scream. A few minutes afterwards the Prince flung open
the door, and rang his bell for assistance. He was pale
and agitated. When the servants rushed up, he said,
‘Your mistress has been taken suddenly ill. Attend to
her,’ and at the same time he ordered a man-servant to
ride with all speed for a doctor from the neighbouring
village, six miles away.</p>

<p>When the servants entered the room, they found Catarina
fully dressed, lying on the bed. Her face was ashen in
its hue. Her eyes seemed starting from her head. Foam
was oozing from her mouth; her limbs were convulsed.
The servants did what they could, but Catarina never
spoke. When the doctor came, she was dead. He examined
her, and said she had died from the effects of some
powerful poison. There was a strange smell in the room;
there was a broken glass on the floor. Before leaving the
house, however, he changed his opinion, and certified that
she had died from apoplexy.</p>

<p>Some nuns were brought from a neighbouring convent
to pray and watch by the body. Three days afterwards
it was quietly and unostentatiously buried in a plain grave
in the little village cemetery. The Prince followed as
chief mourner. An hour later he was a changed man.
He seemed to have grown ten years older. About three
weeks later it was officially announced in the <i>Gazette</i> and
other papers that Prince Ignatof had retired from the
Foreign Office by the advice of his physicians, his health
having completely broken down.</p>

<p>Some few particulars have yet to be told. The letter
which Danevitch intercepted and handed to the Prince
was written by Catarina. It was addressed to Madame
Kasin at Smyrna. There are reasons why the letter should
not be given <i>in extenso</i>, but its substance can be indicated.
The writer made it evident that Madame Kasin, who was
as strongly embittered against her father as he was against
her, conspired with her husband and Buroff and Catarina
to obtain the information contained in the secret treaty,
and sell it for a large sum of money to Turkey, to whom
it was of immense value. Kasin, it appeared, had learnt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
that a treaty was being negotiated; and though Buroff
would not undertake to purloin the document himself,
he was heavily bribed to inform Catarina that he had
brought it.</p>

<p>Between Catarina and Madame Kasin a very strong
friendship existed. Catarina considered the daughter had
been very badly treated. This sympathy and friendship
had led to great ill-feeling between Catarina and the
Prince, who had threatened to send her adrift. She undertook
to abstract the document, but she went to work so
clumsily that, as the saying is, she gave herself away.
And her incautiousness in writing that condemnatory letter
showed that she had not in her the qualities of a trickster
and a thief. She told the whole miserable story in the
letter, and said that she herself would convey the precious
document to Smyrna. She did not mention Nicolayeff’s
name, but Danevitch felt certain that the Clerk of the
Keys had been corrupted in order that the key of the
Prince’s bed-chamber safe should be procured, and to put
his belief to the test he accosted the unfortunate porter in
the street in the way we have seen. His intention was, if
the porter betrayed himself, to place him at once under
arrest. He was not prepared, however, for the sudden
collapse of the wretched man, who did not long survive
the shock and the disgrace.</p>

<p>The whole matter, of course, was hushed up as much as
possible. It was deemed advisable that the details should
not reach the ears of the public. It is perhaps needless
to say that the Kasins, who were ready to prove traitors
to their country, never again set foot on Russian soil.
Danevitch confesses that he was anxious, if possible, to
save the Prince the disgrace of having his own daughter
arrested, hence the telegram. He was sure that telegram
recalling Kasin would sound a note of alarm to him, and
he would take himself off. That proved to be the case.
When some months had elapsed, Buroff was quietly packed
off to Siberia.</p>

<p>The Prince when he had sold off a large proportion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
his estates, went abroad—to France, it is said—where he
spent the rest of his days in strict retirement. Before
leaving Russia, he erected a magnificent and costly marble
monument over the grave of the beautiful Catarina, the
mystery of whose death will never be solved until the secrets
of all hearts are known.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">HOW PETER TRESKIN WAS LURED TO DOOM.</h3>
</div>


<h4>THE FIRST ACT—THE PLOT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> period was the reign of Alexander II. The time, the
afternoon of a day in early summer. The place, an office
in the huge building in St. Petersburg known as the
Palace of the Admiralty, one of the finest and most imposing
structures of the kind in the world. Its principal
front is more than a quarter of a mile in length, while its
wings, which extend to the Neva, are nearly seven hundred
feet long. In this palace an enormous number of people
are employed, including many women; and here the whole
business in connection with the Imperial navy is transacted.</p>

<p>The office referred to was a large room lighted by several
long windows. Running the whole length of the room
was a flat-topped mahogany desk, on which were spread a
number of plans of vessels, tracing-papers, compasses,
squares, pencils, and other things of a like kind usually
found in the office of a draughtsman. To give the place
its official description, it was ‘Department H, Left Wing,
Second Floor, Room 12. Imperial Yachts.’</p>

<p>It was under the control of a much-trusted Government
servant, one Samuel Snell. That was not a Russian name,
but an English one. Snell was an Englishman—a Cockney,
for he was born within sound of Bow bells. He had been
brought up as an engineer’s designer and draughtsman, and
was considered very clever. He left his native country
when he was three-and-twenty, and went to Russia, induced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
thereto by a Russian friend in trade in London, who
had taught him to speak the Russian language, and assured
him that his talents would find greater appreciation and a
better market abroad than at home. Samuel Snell was
influenced by this, and went. He was fortunate, through
his friend’s influence, in speedily obtaining employment,
and having marked ability, he made his way.</p>

<p>In the course of time he obtained naturalization;
married a Russian lady, the daughter of a gentleman holding
an appointment in the naval construction department;
and ultimately, through his father-in-law’s influence,
obtained an appointment himself as assistant copyist in
the Admiralty Palace. His talents soon made him conspicuous;
he was singled out for gradual promotion, until
at last he was placed at the supreme head of the department
responsible for the building and repairs of the Imperial
yachts. It was no sinecure, but an important and
responsible position.</p>

<p>In this room, on the day and at the hour in question,
two young women were seated. One had soft brown hair,
bright blue eyes, a delicate complexion, and regular
features. She was the daughter of Snell, and was just
twenty years of age. Her name was Catherine. She was
unmistakably of an English type, though born in Russia,
of a Russian mother, and had never been out of the
country in her life. Her companion was as unmistakably
Russian; she had dark eyes, black hair, olive complexion,
and was slightly older than the other girl. They were
both good-looking. The brunette was called Anna Plevski.
Her face indicated great strength of character. She had
a strong, determined mouth; intelligence beamed from her
eyes; her forehead spoke of brain-power.</p>

<p>Their respective positions were as follows: Catherine
was a confidential clerk to her father. She had been
specially trained for the work, and had held the appointment
for over three years. Anna was in another department
altogether. She was what was termed ‘an indexer.’</p>

<p>The two girls were friends. They had been to school
together. Anna had taken advantage of a little relaxation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
to slip into Room 12 to have a chat with Catherine, for
she knew Mr. Snell was away; he had gone down to
Kronstadt on official business. But it wasn’t for the sake
of a purposeless chat that Anna went to Room 12. She
had a deep and dark design, as was destined to be revealed
at a later stage of this strange and tragic drama. Her
own department was a long way off, in another part of the
huge building, and she was at some trouble to reach her
friend’s office by a very circuitous and round-about route,
anxious, presumably, that it shouldn’t be generally known
that she had gone to Room 12.</p>

<p>‘It’s a beautiful day, Catherine, isn’t it?’ said Anna,
after some preliminary greeting. ‘It’s a pity you and I
are not rich.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’ asked Catherine, with a simple expression on
her pretty face.</p>

<p>‘Surely you don’t need to ask why. If we were not
mere drudges, we should be able to taste some of the
pleasures of the world—go where we liked, stay as long
as we liked, and enjoy ourselves generally, instead of being
stewed up here when the sun is shining.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you know, money doesn’t always bring happiness,
Anna, my dear,’ answered Catherine.</p>

<p>‘It may not always do so; but as sure as eggs are eggs
there can be precious little happiness without it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t know. Contentment goes a long way,’
Catherine said, with some timidity, for she knew that her
friend held very pronounced views, was unusually strong-minded,
and had an iron will, to say nothing of an unyielding
dogmatism, which occasionally, when stirred up,
became objectionable, and at times offensive. In short,
Anna had an aggressive spirit, and was disposed to find
fault with all constituted authority.</p>

<p>‘Contentment!’ she echoed with a malicious sort of
chuckle; ‘how can one be contented with a lot that is
hard, toilsome, and irritating? It’s not pleasant to realize
every hour of your life that you are only a drudge. I ask
myself over and over again why wealth is so unequally
distributed. Why should it be in the hands of the few,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
while the vast majority of mankind are the slaves of those
few, and groan and sweat under the yoke of paid labour—for
what? merely to keep body and soul together.’</p>

<p>Catherine had heard her friend express similar sentiments
before, so that she was not surprised at this bluntness of
speech; but as she herself did not consider she had any
particular cause to complain, and as the views she held
were not altogether in accordance with Anna’s, she ventured
to mildly express dissent from Anna’s doctrine. It only
seemed, however, to arouse that young woman to a more
vigorous display of her feelings, and with a pepperiness
that was distinctly characteristic of her, she exclaimed
scoffingly:</p>

<p>‘Well, friend Catherine, I can’t help saying that I’ve no
patience with anyone who is willing to accept stripes and
lashes without a murmur. That’s not my spirit. I’ve got
brains, so have you, and yet we are forced to toil long
hours every day for bare sustenance, while thousands and
tens of thousands of brainless louts are rolling in riches.
Ugh! It makes me mad to think of it.’</p>

<p>Catherine smiled prettily as she remarked:</p>

<p>‘You seem to have been stirred up to-day, dear. Something
has put you out of temper.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I am out of temper. I’m dissatisfied. Why,
only to-day an order was issued in our department that we
are to work two hours extra every day owing to pressure
of work; but, as you know, the miserly Government take
precious good care they won’t pay us so much as an extra
copeck, no matter how long we work. I say it’s shameful!’</p>

<p>‘But what’s the use of fretting about it if we cannot
alter it?’ asked Catherine.</p>

<p>‘But I say we can alter it. The working classes of this
country are the bone, sinew, and brains of the country;
yet they are kept in shackles and ground into the dust.’</p>

<p>‘And yet, after all, Anna, talent is always recognised,
and individualism will make its mark.’</p>

<p>‘Great heavens!’ cried Anna, lifting her dark eyebrows
in amazement, while she looked at her friend with something
like pitying contempt, ‘is it possible that you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
cheat yourself into the belief that that is true? You know
as well as I do that talent and individualism are not worth
a rap without influence to advance them. Kissing goes by
favour in this world; and if you’ve no influence you may
starve, while some idiot is pitchforked into power and
authority. But, there, don’t let us wrangle any more at
present. Some day I shall convert you, and bring you
round to my views. By the way, I see that our Little
Father, the Czar, is to make a yachting cruise round the
coast of Finland next month, and that his yacht, the
<i>North Star</i>, is to be entirely overhauled and refitted.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that is so.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a very fine yacht, isn’t it, the <i>North Star?</i>’</p>

<p>‘I should think so. I’ve never seen it, though.’</p>

<p>‘That’s a wonder. I thought your father could have
taken you on board any of the Emperor’s yachts.’</p>

<p>‘So he could, I’ve no doubt; though he has never done
so.’</p>

<p>‘But you have the plans of the <i>North Star</i> in this department,
haven’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes.’</p>

<p>‘I should like to see them. Would you mind showing
them to me? I want to know what this grand vessel is
like.’</p>

<p>Catherine hesitated; but failing to see that she would
do any harm by complying with her friend’s request, she
went to a huge safe, and took therefrom a large roll of
cartridge-paper, which she spread out on the desk, and
kept it in position by weights at the corners. And then
there was revealed to Anna a scale drawing, showing the
hull, the sections, the ground-plan, and general design of
the Imperial vessel, which was one of several used by his
Majesty for pleasure cruises.</p>

<p>This particular one was then in the hands of the
Admiralty for refit and overhaul, and was under orders to
be at Kronstadt on the 20th of the following month; to
receive the royal party, including the Czar, for a trip up
the Gulf of Bothnia, and along the coast of Sweden,
returning by the coast of Finland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>Anna looked at the plan attentively, critically. Indeed,
she studied it; and having an excellent memory, the result
of training as an ‘indexer,’ she was enabled to carry the
whole of the plan in her mind’s eye.</p>

<p>She would have liked to have made some notes, but did
not dare do so, and so she fixed the details in her mind.</p>

<p>‘The Little Father’s apartments seem very spacious,’
Anna remarked carelessly, as though she meant nothing.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ said Catherine; ‘but they are all to be reconstructed,
and removed from the after-part of the vessel,
where they are now.’</p>

<p>Anna’s dark eyes opened wide, and her ears were all
alertness.</p>

<p>‘Indeed! Why?’</p>

<p>‘Well, they are in the extreme stern of the ship now;
and as the vessel pitches very much, they are not comfortable.’</p>

<p>‘Then, where are the Czar’s rooms to be placed?’ asked
Anna eagerly.</p>

<p>‘A large deckhouse is to be constructed amidships. It
will be fitted up like a little palace.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! umph! I understand,’ Anna muttered thoughtfully.
‘Then I suppose that is where the rooms will be?’
and she placed her finger in the centre of the plan.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>Catherine made a movement to remove the weights
from the corners of the paper, when Anna exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘Stop a minute. I just want to look at something.
All right. Thanks. It’s most interesting. I wish I were
a rich person, that I could have a steam-yacht like that,
and go where I liked.’</p>

<p>‘You should marry an emperor; then you would have
all you could desire,’ said Catherine with a laugh, as she
rolled the draft plan up and restored it to the safe.</p>

<p>‘No; I wouldn’t be an empress if I had the chance,’
Anna replied tartly. ‘Kings, queens, emperors, empresses,
and the like, are all tyrants. There should be no crowned
heads. I don’t believe in ’em. They are a curse to the
world.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>‘Anna, you surprise me!’ said Catherine with a frightened
look. ‘I knew you were peculiar, and held remarkable
views, but I had no idea you were disloyal.’</p>

<p>‘Hadn’t you, dear?’ answered Anna, with a laugh.
‘Well, well, don’t take me too seriously, you know. I say
some queer things sometimes.’</p>

<p>Then, suddenly throwing her arms round her friend’s
neck, she kissed her on both cheeks and sped out of the
room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The scene changes. In what is known as the St. Petersburg
quarter, which is situated on the north side of the
Neva, is an old and lofty house, not unlike some of the old
buildings in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The house is let out in tenements, and there is a common
stair for the use of all the tenants, who for the most part
are working men, artisans, and the like. At the very top
of the building, immediately under the tiles, is a long
room with a slanting roof. In this room three men are at
work, busily at work, though it is the dead of night. They
carry on their work by lamplight.</p>

<p>Two are seated at a bench, which is covered with a
miscellaneous lot of tools—pliers, small hammers, pincers,
files, tiny saws, screw-drivers, chisels of various shapes,
punches, etc. There are also sets of mathematical instruments;
and before the men are carefully-prepared diagrams
and drawings to scale, and to these the men make constant
reference.</p>

<p>They are fitting together an ingenious and clever piece
of mechanism in a small oblong box, lined with tin, and
divided into compartments. It is a sort of clockwork
arrangement they are engaged upon, and it is intended
that the motive power of this mechanism shall be a noiseless
spring, acting on a solid brass, notched wheel. In the
rim of this wheel are forty-eight notches. The wheel can
be made to revolve slowly or quickly, as may be desired.
As the wheel revolves, every time a notch reaches a given
point, mathematically determined, a tiny, but powerful,
steel lever drops into it, and this causes a steel rod, something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
like a miniature shaft of a screw-steamer, to advance
at right angles with the wheel towards a partition at the
end of the box.</p>

<p>When this rod or shaft has been pushed forward a stage,
the lever rises again, until the next notch is reached, when
the same thing occurs, and the rod gets a little nearer to
the partition, in which, immediately facing the point of
the rod, is a circular hole corresponding in circumference
to the rod itself, so that ultimately the rod must pass
through the hole into a recess between the partition and
the end of the box.</p>

<p>The object of this will presently be seen. The two men,
who are evidently skilled mechanics of a high class, are both
young. Neither of them has yet numbered thirty years.</p>

<p>A third man is engaged in a totally different occupation.
He is an old man, tall and thin, with a grave, professional
face, small, keen eyes, and a high forehead. He is dressed
in a long, dark blouse, and wears a black silk skull-cap.
He has a square table before him in the centre of the room;
on it are retorts, crucibles, phials, mortars, and pestles.</p>

<p>In a retort, beneath which burns a spirit-lamp, he is compounding
something from which most obnoxious vapours
arise, but immediately above is a skylight, which is open
to give egress to the fumes.</p>

<p>The man watches the retort anxiously and nervously,
and every few minutes he plunges a small thermometer
into the boiling liquid, and then, withdrawing it, reads by
the light of an Argand lamp what the figures indicate.
At last he suddenly extinguishes the flame of the spirit,
utters a sigh of relief, and straightens his aching back.
As he does so, one of the two young men turns towards
him, and says:</p>

<p>‘Well, Professor, have you finished?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, thank God, I have, and I am glad.’</p>

<p>It seemed like blasphemy that he should have thanked
God, having regard to the deadly objects of his work.
But the phrase was either uttered carelessly, or he was a
fanatic who believed that what he was doing was blessed
of Heaven.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>Presently there were three light taps on the door. The
men paused in their labours and listened. Then the
Professor advanced noiselessly to the door, and gave
three raps himself.</p>

<p>This was followed from outside by two quick raps, then
two deliberate ones. Instantly on receiving this signal the
professor turned the key, opened the door, and admitted a
man, who wore a large cloak, which, on entering the room,
he threw off, and a handsome, striking young man was
revealed, with a strongly-marked face, and a well-shaped
head covered with dark, curly hair.</p>

<p>It was a face full of intellectuality. The mouth, which
was shaded by a carefully-trimmed moustache, was well
shaped, but the lower jaw was heavy, and destroyed the
general symmetry of the features. His eyes were almost
coal-black, restless, and full of fire. They indicated an
intense nervous energy.</p>

<p>There was something—it is really difficult to define it—about
the man’s whole appearance which suggested the
masterful, commanding spirit—the leader of men. And
when he spoke, the full, resonant voice, the rich, decisive
tones, accentuated and emphasized this something, and
proclaimed that he was one to be feared, to be obeyed.
Peter Treskin—that was his name—was in every way a
remarkable man. And even at the present day there are
parts of Russia where he is referred to with sorrow, and
spoken of with reverence.</p>

<p>Peter Treskin came of good family. He was intended
for the law, and had studied hard and acquired an immense
amount of general knowledge. But somehow he had been
attracted to a set of malcontents, who were for revolutionizing
everything and everybody.</p>

<p>They believed, or fancied they believed, which was much
the same thing, that it was their mission to set the world
right; to alter this and change that, to pull down thrones
and set up their own forms of government, which would
be so perfect, so just, so equitable, that every human
wrong and every human sorrow would be done away
with.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>It was the Utopian dream of lotus-eaters; but fools
have dreamed it through all time; they will go on dreaming
it until time closes, and instead of ending sorrow, they
will, as they have ever done, increase it manifold.</p>

<p>However, these men thought differently, and Peter
Treskin’s vanity was gratified, his ambition found a
channel, his fiery disposition a means of satisfying it; and
as he never played second fiddle to anyone, he was raised
to a height, from which he commanded.</p>

<p>In other words, he became the head of a vast conspiracy
which had for its object the destruction of the rulers who
then ruled. In short, Peter, at the head of a mob, so to
speak, opposed himself to the constituted forces of law and
order.</p>

<p>It is true those forces were not what they might, and
perhaps ought to, have been. They were stern, in many
ways oppressive, in some respects unjust, and often ungenerous;
but Peter Treskin’s methods were not calculated
to change them.</p>

<p>It was astonishing, however, how he was enabled to
enlist clever and intellectual men of all sorts and conditions
under his banner, which, figuratively speaking, was
inscribed with one word of ghastly import—Revolution!</p>

<p>‘Well, friends, how does the work go on?’ he asked, as
he entered the room, wiped his perspiring forehead with
his handkerchief, and then, with a quick, nervous touch,
rolled a cigarette and lit it.</p>

<p>‘We’ve nearly finished,’ answered one of the two men.
‘By to-morrow night the machine will be ready.’</p>

<p>‘Good! excellent! bravo!’ said Treskin. ‘And you,
Professor?’</p>

<p>‘My part is also nearly completed. It has been a
dangerous operation, but will be successful.’</p>

<p>The man who spoke was Professor Smolski, a clever
chemist, whose researches and knowledge, if properly
applied, might have been of immense benefit to the world,
and have earned him a niche in the gallery of worthies.
But he had ranged himself on the side of the malcontents,
and for the sake of his craze he was willing to sacrifice the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
prospects of fame, if not fortune, and to run the almost
certain risk of a shameful death. Truly human nature is
a mystery.</p>

<p>The other two men were brothers—Jews, Isaac and Jacob
Eisenmann. They were born in Russia, but their parents
had fled from Germany to avoid persecution, though, in
flying from the hornets, they had encountered the wasps;
that is to say, they had found no peace in Russia. They
had been oppressed, persecuted, harried, and their offspring
had vowed vengeance. Isaac and Jacob were sworn foes of
the Government. They were clever mechanics, and their
cleverness was used to build up a destructive instrument of
death, contrived with devilish ingenuity and diabolical
cunning.</p>

<p>These men represented a large party, which included
women as well as men; but Treskin was the head, the
leading light, the impelling spirit. His influence, his
restless energy, his ambition, his vanity, made him one of
the most dangerous men in all Russia. He seemed able
by some extraordinary power he possessed of swerving men
from the paths of rectitude into the tortuous ways of
crime. He led women like lambs to the slaughter; he
bent even strong men to his will.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, however, up to the time that he is
brought under the reader’s notice, he had managed to
escape falling under suspicion. It is difficult to say what
this immunity was due to; possibly some superior cunning,
some extraordinary cautiousness. But whatever it was,
Peter was not wanting in courage, and was quite ready to
take his share of risk.</p>

<p>His co-conspirators now proceeded to explain to him
the result of their labours and their ingenuity. The
empty recess at the end of the mechanical box was to be
filled with a novel preparation containing a latent explosive
power of immense force. This latent power, however,
could only be aroused into activity by the combination of
a chemical fluid, and in order to bring this about, the
mechanism had been arranged with wonderful precision
and cleverness. Professor Smolski had produced the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
necessary fluid, and the two Jews had, between them, constructed
the machinery. At the end of the rod or shaft
already described a glass tube, hermetically sealed, would
be attached by fitting into a socket. As the rod was
advanced by the revolving notched wheel, which could be
set to do its work in one hour or forty-eight, the glass
tube would ultimately be thrust through the hole in the
partition, where, coming in contact with an opposing rigid
bar of iron, it would break, and then instantly something
like a cataclysm would follow.</p>

<p>This, of course, only describes the machine in rough
outline, and that is all that is intended to be done. Those
who are curious to learn the details of the strange instrument
of death and destruction will find drawings of it
preserved in the police archives of St. Petersburg. It was,
at the time, the most perfect and certain thing of its kind
that man’s devilishness had been able to create. And in
some respects it is doubtful if it has been improved upon
up to the present day.</p>

<p>Four o’clock was striking when Peter Treskin stole forth
from that reeking den of evil designs, and made his way
into the sweet, fresh air. Overhead the stars burned with
an effulgency only seen in a Northern climate. Peace and
silence reigned in the sleeping city. The clear, pellucid
waters of the Neva glistened and glinted as they flowed to
the sea, emblematic of the Stream of Time, which silently
but surely sweeps all men into the great ocean of eternity,
and obliterates even their memory.</p>

<p>Man’s life is a little thing indeed when compared with
the stupendousness of Time and Eternity. The bright
stars shine, the rivers roll for ever; but man is born to-day;
to-morrow he is dust and forgotten. No such feeling or
sentiment, however, stirred Peter Treskin’s emotion as he
hurried along to his lodgings. He was elated, nevertheless,
and full of a fierce, wicked joy, for his designs seemed
to be going well. He had that night seen the completion,
or almost the completion, of an instrument of destruction
which was calculated and intended to strike terror into the
hearts of tyrants, and he even believed that the hour was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
at hand when constituted power and authority, as it then
existed, would be shattered into the dust, and from its
ruins a new order of things would arise, in which he would
figure as a supreme ruler.</p>

<p>Fools have dreamed these dreams before, and awakened
with the curses of their fellow-men ringing in their ears;
and then, having died a shameful death, have been thrust,
unhonoured and unwept, into a nameless grave. But
Treskin was not disturbed by any gloomy forebodings, and
having reached his lodgings, he hurried to bed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The scene shifts once more, and shows us Kronstadt, a
busy, thriving seaport, arsenal, and naval and military
town, at the head of the Gulf of Finland, exactly thirty-one
miles west from St. Petersburg. The town is built on
an island, and is so strongly fortified that it is called the
‘Malta of the Baltic.’ The greater portion of the Imperial
navy assembles here, and there are armour and appliances,
not only for repairing vessels, but building men-of-war.
There are three great harbours. Two are used exclusively
for the Imperial ships, and the third is a general harbour
capable of accommodating seven hundred vessels. In the
winter no trade with the outer world is carried on, owing
to the ice; but during the summer months the flags of
various nationalities may be seen, but by far the largest
number of foreign vessels visiting Kronstadt sail under the
British flag.</p>

<p>At this place, one summer afternoon, a man and woman
arrived, and made their way to a tavern near the entrance
to the general harbour. The woman was young, good-looking,
very dark, but her features wore a careworn expression,
and she seemed to glance about her with a
nervous fear, as though she was in dread of something.
The man was of middle height; he had an iron-gray beard
and iron-gray hair. Judging from his grayness, he was
advanced in years; but his step was firm, his eyes, which
were very dark, were the eyes of youth—they were restless
and full of fire. He carried a leather hand-bag, which he
deposited on a chair beside him as he and the woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
seated themselves at a table outside of the tavern and
ordered refreshment, which was served by the tavern-keeper
himself. The stranger got into conversation with the
landlord, and asked him many questions.</p>

<p>‘Where is the Little Father’s yacht, the <i>North Star</i>,
lying?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Out there, moored to that big buoy. You will see she
has the Imperial flag flying.’ As he spoke, the landlord
pointed to the outside of the harbour, where a large steam-yacht,
painted white, was moored. A thin film of smoke
was issuing from her funnels, and a little wreath of steam
from her steam-pipes. ‘She has been outside into the
roadstead this morning to adjust her compasses. I see a
bargeload of stores has just gone off to her.’</p>

<p>‘At what hour will the Imperial party arrive to-morrow?’</p>

<p>‘They are timed, I understand, to be here at nine o’clock,’
said the landlord.</p>

<p>‘The Czar is a stickler for punctuality, isn’t he?’ asked
the stranger.</p>

<p>‘Yes. I understand he is seldom behind time if he can
help it. Well, his Majesty will have a good trip, I hope.
The weather promises to be fine. God protect him!’</p>

<p>‘She is a fine yacht, is the <i>North Star</i>, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Splendid! Magnificent! I once had the honour of
going on board by the courtesy of one of the officers, who
gave me an order. But she was laid up then, and partly
dismantled. Now would be the time to see her, when she
is all ready for the Little Father’s reception. But that is
impossible. No one not connected with the vessel would
be allowed on board.’</p>

<p>The stranger smiled, as he remarked:</p>

<p>‘I am not connected with the vessel, and yet I am going
on board.’</p>

<p>‘You are!’ cried the host in astonishment. ‘Impossible!’</p>

<p>‘By no means impossible. I have official business.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, of course, that’s another thing. Well, I
envy you.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>When the landlord had gone about his affairs, the girl
said to her companion, speaking in low tones:</p>

<p>‘You are a fool to talk about your intentions in that
way. You are simply directing attention to yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Tut! hold your tongue! What does it matter?
There is nothing to fear from this thick-headed publican.’</p>

<p>‘But you ought to be more careful—you ought indeed,’
urged the girl tearfully. ‘You are far too reckless. Remember
the tremendous risks you are running—we are
running—for if you sacrifice yourself you sacrifice me too.’</p>

<p>‘Are you beginning to funk?’ asked the man irritably.</p>

<p>‘No. But there is no reason why the risks should be
made greater than they are. We have a great task to
accomplish, and every possible caution should be exercised.’</p>

<p>‘Well, now what have I done that is wrong?’ demanded
the man angrily.</p>

<p>‘You told the landlord you were going on board the
yacht. It was foolish to do that. You drew attention to
yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Possibly you are right—possibly you are right,’ her companion
returned thoughtfully. ‘It was a little bit of vanity
on my part, but it slipped out. However, all will be well.
Our plans are so well laid it is impossible for them to
miscarry.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing is impossible; nothing should be counted upon
as certain until it is accomplished,’ the girl said.</p>

<p>‘You are a nice sort of Job’s comforter. Do, for
goodness’ sake, keep quiet!’ answered the man snappishly.
He was evidently in a highly nervous state, and very
irritable. ‘Well, I must go. Be sure, now, that you
don’t stir from here until I return.’</p>

<p>‘I understand,’ said the girl. ‘But, remember, the
suspense will be awful. Don’t be away from me a minute
longer than you can help.’</p>

<p>He promised that he would not. Then, taking up his
hand-bag, he embraced his companion and went out.
Making his way down to the quay, he hired a boat, and
instructed the boatman to row him to the Imperial yacht.</p>

<p>On reaching the vessel, he was challenged by the sentry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
on duty at the gangway, and he replied that he had come
on official business, and had a Government order. Whereupon
he was allowed to get on to the lower grating of the
steps, where an officer came to him, and he produced a
Government document, stamped with the official seal, and
setting forth that his name was Ivan Orloff, that he was
one of the naval clockmakers, and had been sent down to
adjust all the clocks on board the <i>North Star</i> preparatory
to the Czar’s arrival. Such an order could not be gainsaid,
so he was admitted on board, but an armed sailor was told
off to accompany him about the ship, and show him where
the various clocks were situated. There were a good many
clocks, as every officer had one in his cabin.</p>

<p>The man came at last to the Czar’s suite of apartments
in the newly-constructed deckhouse. The sailor paused
at the entrance to cross himself before a sacred picture
that hung on the bulkhead, but Orloff pushed on, and,
passing beneath costly and magnificent curtains, he reached
the Czar’s sleeping-cabin, which was a dream of splendour.
With quick, hurried movements he took from his bag an
oblong box, turned a handle on an index dial, and placed
the box beneath the royal bed. He scarcely had time to
recover his position, and get to a chest of drawers on which
stood a superb clock, when the sailor entered, and said
gruffly:</p>

<p>‘You ought to have waited for me.’</p>

<p>‘I’m in a hurry, friend,’ said Orloff. ‘I want to get my
work finished and return to St. Petersburg to-night.’</p>

<p>As he lifted the glass shade off the clock, his hands
trembled and his face was as white as marble, but the
sailor did not notice it.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Orloff had completed his task, and
took his departure, and landing once more on the quay, he
made his way to the tavern and joined the girl.</p>

<p>‘Have you succeeded?’ she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Yes. But a sailor kept guard over me, and I was
afraid the plan would have miscarried; I racked my brains
trying to find an excuse for freeing myself from him. But
fortune favoured me. He stopped to mumble a prayer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
before an ikon, and I seized the opportunity to get into
the Tsar’s bed-chamber, where I planted the machine. It
is set for thirty-three hours, and will go off to-morrow
night when the Tsar has retired to his couch.’</p>

<p>The girl looked frightened, and said nervously:</p>

<p>‘Well, let us leave here, and get back without a moment’s
delay.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t worry yourself, my child; there is plenty of time.
I am going to dine first.’</p>

<p>He ordered dinner for two and half a bottle of vodka
beforehand by way of an appetizer, and, having drunk
pretty freely, he and the girl strolled out while the dinner
was being prepared.</p>

<p>It was a glorious evening. The sun was setting. The
heavens were dyed with crimson fire. In the clear atmosphere
the masts and rigging of the vessels stood out with
a sharpness of definition that was remarkable. There was
no wind. The water of the gulf was motionless.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a tremendous shock as if a great
gun had been fired, and in a few moments a cry arose from
a hundred throats that something had happened on board
the Imperial yacht. The air about her was filled with
splinters of wood. Men could be seen running along her
decks in a state of great excitement, and she appeared to
be heeling over to the starboard side. ‘Her boilers have
burst,’ cried the people, as they rushed pell-mell to the
quay, while from all parts of the harbour boats were
hurriedly making their way to the <i>North Star</i>, as it was
thought that she was foundering.</p>


<h4>THE SECOND ACT—THE UNRAVELLING OF THE PLOT.</h4>

<p>When the explosion on board the Imperial yacht occurred,
Orloff and the girl were strolling along one of the quays
which commanded a full view of the harbour, and, attracted
by the tremendous report, they turned their eyes seaward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
to behold a dense column of vapourish smoke rising upwards,
and wreckage of all kinds filling the air. The girl
staggered, and reeled against her companion, and he,
clapping his hand suddenly to his forehead, exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘My God! what have I done? The machine has
gone off before its time. I must have set the index
wrong.’</p>

<p>The excitement both on shore and in the harbour was
tremendous, otherwise Orloff and the woman would surely
have drawn attention to themselves by the terror and
nervousness they displayed.</p>

<p>‘We are lost! we are lost!’ wailed the woman.</p>

<p>At this the man seemed to suddenly recover his self-possession.</p>

<p>‘Peace, fool!’ he muttered savagely between his teeth.
‘We are not lost.’</p>

<p>He glanced round him anxiously for some moments;
then, seeing a boat containing a solitary boatman about to
put off from the quay, he said hurriedly to his companion,
‘Stop here for a little while; I will return shortly.’</p>

<p>She was so dazed and stupefied that she made no attempt
to stop him, and he hurried away, rushed down a flight of
stone steps, and hailed the boatman.</p>

<p>After a few words of haggling and bargaining, Orloff
sprang into the little craft and the boatman rowed rapidly
out towards the <i>North Star</i>.</p>

<p>The girl waited and waited in a fever of anxiety and
impatience. She paced the quay—up and down, up and
down. To and fro she went. Her face was as white as
bleached marble. Her dark flashing eyes bespoke the fear
she felt. Her hands opened and shut spasmodically from
the extreme nervous tension she felt.</p>

<p>All the light of day faded out of the sky. A blood-red
streak did linger in the western sky for a time, but was
suddenly extinguished by the black robe of Night. The
girl still paced the quay, but Orloff did not return. She
heard the gossip of people as they returned to the shore
from the harbour, and from this she gathered that the
Imperial yacht had been partially destroyed, and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
lives had been lost. The prevailing opinion was that the
mischief was due to the bursting of a boiler.</p>

<p>Unable longer to endure her misery, the girl went back
to the tavern. The landlord came to her, and asked if
she had been off to the wreck.</p>

<p>‘No,’ she answered. ‘My husband has gone. It’s an
awful business, isn’t it? They say the boiler of the steamer
blew up, and that there have been many lives lost.’</p>

<p>‘I heard that half the crew are killed,’ said the landlord.
‘God be praised that the accident occurred before our
Little Father arrived! It’s a Providential escape.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered the girl sullenly.</p>

<p>The landlord asked her if she would have dinner, as it
was all ready. She replied that she would wait for her
husband. She drank some vodka, however, to steady her
nerves, and smoked a cigarette.</p>

<p>Presently she went forth again, and paced the quay,
going back to the tavern after a time to learn that Orloff
had not returned. It was then a little after nine. And
as the last train to St. Petersburg started at half-past nine,
she settled the bill at the tavern, and, taking the leather
bag with her, hurried to the station and got back to town.
She was full of nervous apprehension, and puzzled to
account for the strange disappearance of Orloff. Had he
deserted her? Had he been apprehended? The suspense
was horrible. It almost drove her mad.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the news of the disaster on board the Czar’s yacht
reached St. Petersburg, the consternation was tremendous,
and a special train filled with Government officials, including
Michael Danevitch, started at once for Kronstadt
to investigate the affair on the spot.</p>

<p>Several bodies had been recovered and brought on shore.
They were laid out in a shed on the quay. The shed was
lighted by oil-lamps, and their feeble glimmer revealed a
ghastly sight. The bodies were all more or less mutilated.
Some were unrecognisable. There were nine altogether,
including the chief officer and the chief engineer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>The captain arrived with the Government officials. He
had been in town, and was to have travelled down the
next day in the Emperor’s suite.</p>

<p>In mustering his ship’s company, he found that twenty-three
were missing altogether. Nine of that number were
lying in the shed. The rest were being searched for by
boats. Several were recovered, but some drifted out with
the currents and were seen no more.</p>

<p>Investigations soon proved that the destruction was not
due to the bursting of a boiler. The boilers were intact.
The cause of the disaster, therefore, was a mystery, until
somebody on board, having recovered his presence of mind
after the dreadful shock, referred to the visit of the Government
clock-winder.</p>

<p>That sounded suspicious. As far as the officials knew,
no one had been sent down to wind the clocks. But still,
as the fellow had come furnished with Government-stamped
credentials, it was probably all right.</p>

<p>Owing, however, to some strange oversight or stupid
blunder, nothing could be ascertained then, as no one was
at the telegraph-office in St. Petersburg to receive messages,
and so the night wore itself out, and many hours’ start was
given to Orloff and his co-conspirators.</p>

<p>During this time Danevitch was not idle. He knew,
perhaps better than anyone else, how the Emperor was
encompassed round about with enemies who sought his
destruction, and the wily detective smelt treason in the
air.</p>

<p>Although it was night, Kronstadt kept awake, for people
were too excited to sleep, and a messenger was despatched
to St. Petersburg on an engine, whose driver was ordered
to cover the distance in an hour—a fast run for Russia.
The messenger was furnished with a description of Orloff—at
this time it was not known that a woman had been
with him; it will be remembered she did not go on board—and
was told to lose not a moment in circulating that
description.</p>

<p>Then Danevitch began inquiries on his own account in
Kronstadt. From the survivors on board the yacht he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
ascertained at what time Orloff went on board; an hour
and a half before he presented himself a train had arrived
from St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>He had probably arrived by that train. The boatman
who took him off to the yacht was found. He said the
supposed clock-winder carried a black bag with him both
going and coming.</p>

<p>After his return to the shore only two trains left for
St. Petersburg. By neither of those trains did he travel,
so far as could be ascertained.</p>

<p>The sailor who had been told off to accompany Orloff
over the vessel was amongst the missing; but it was
gathered that when the clock-winder had gone the sailor
mentioned to some of his companions that he had been
much annoyed by the stranger rushing forward to the
Emperor’s bed-chamber, while he (the sailor) was mumbling
a prayer before an ikon (sacred picture) which hung at
the entrance.</p>

<p>When he got into the room, he noticed that the stranger
was pale and flurried, as if he had received a shock. Those
who heard the story thought the sailor’s imagination had
run away with him, and so no importance or significance
was attached to what he said.</p>

<p>The destructive force of the explosion on board the
<i>North Star</i> had been tremendous. Not only had the
whole of the Czar’s rooms been completely destroyed, but
a large section of the ship’s decks and bulwarks had been
shattered, and one of her plates started, so that the water
came in so fast that the pumps had to be kept going,
while preparations were made to tow her into the docks,
for her own engines being damaged, they would not work.</p>

<p>Soon after six in the morning, the engine that had been
sent to the capital returned and brought some more
officials. They stated that, from inquiries made, no one
by the name of Orloff had been sent down to regulate the
clocks on board the Czar’s yacht.</p>

<p>All the clocks on board the Imperial fleet were kept in
order by contract, and no special warrant had been supplied
to anybody of the name of Orloff.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>This information made it clear that a dastardly conspiracy
was at work, and it was easy to surmise that the
explosion on board the yacht was premature. The intention
evidently was that it should take place after the
Czar had embarked; but the cowardly wretches, by some
blundering, had allowed their mine to go off too soon, and
though many innocent people had been sacrificed, and
immense damage done to valuable property, the life of the
Emperor had been spared.</p>

<p>It was not long before Danevitch found out that the
man calling himself Orloff, and a female companion, had
put up at a tavern near the quay, and the landlord gave
all the information he could.</p>

<p>He stated that Orloff told him he was going on board
the vessel, and started off for that purpose, leaving the
woman behind him. He returned later, and ordered
dinner, and then he and the woman went off again for a
stroll.</p>

<p>After the explosion the woman returned alone, and
hurried away by herself, taking the black bag with her, to
catch the last train.</p>

<p>This was instructive, but it was also puzzling. It was
established that the woman did go up by the last train,
but not Orloff. What had become of him?</p>

<p>Danevitch took measures to have every outlet from
Kronstadt watched. Then he set off for St. Petersburg.
In reasoning the matter out, it was clear to him that
several, perhaps many, persons had had a hand in the
conspiracy.</p>

<p>The infernal machine carried on board the <i>North Star</i>
by the man calling himself Orloff was hardly likely to be
the work of one man. Any way, a woman was mixed up in
the business.</p>

<p>The official document that Orloff had presented was
written on Government paper, and it bore the Government
seal. The officer of the <i>North Star</i> who had
examined it before admitting the pseudo-clock-regulator,
and who was amongst those who escaped without hurt
from the explosion, testified to that.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>Such being the case, and the order being written on
what was known as ‘Admiralty’ paper, it followed that it
must have been stolen from the Admiralty office. It
struck Danevitch that the thief was probably a female
employé in the Admiralty Palace, and that it was she who
accompanied Orloff to Kronstadt.</p>

<p>This was a mere surmise, but it seemed feasible, and
with Danevitch all theories were worth testing. Whoever
it was, in the hurry of leaving the tavern at that town
she had left behind her a glove.</p>

<p>It was a black silk-thread glove, ornamented at the
back with sprigs worked in white silk. With this glove
in his possession, Danevitch proceeded to the Admiralty
Palace. But as soon as he arrived he learnt that Miss
Catherine Snell had made a statement about Anna Plevski
having visited Room 12 and requested to look at the
plans of the <i>North Star</i>.</p>

<p>Anna was at once confronted with Danevitch. Asked
where she had been the night before, she replied indignantly,
‘At home, of course.’</p>

<p>Did she know a person named Orloff? No, she did not.
Why did she go to Catherine Snell and ask her to show
her the plans of the <i>North Star?</i> Simply to gratify her
curiosity, nothing else. She was next asked if she had
worn gloves the day previous. She replied that she had.
What sort were they? Kid gloves, she answered. Had
she those gloves with her? No; she had left them at
home, and had come to the office that morning without
gloves.</p>

<p>After a few more inquiries she was allowed to return to
her duties, but was kept under strict surveillance, while
poor Catherine Snell was suspended for dereliction of
duty.</p>

<p>In the meantime Danevitch proceeded to Anna’s lodgings,
and a search there brought to light the fellow to the glove
left in the tavern at Kronstadt. It had been thrown carelessly
by the girl on the top of a chest of drawers. This
glove was a damning piece of evidence that Anna had
accompanied Orloff to Kronstadt the day before, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
established, it was a logical deduction that she had stolen
the stamped paper on which he had written, or caused to
be written, the order which had gained him admission on
board of the <i>North Star</i>. All this, of course, was plain
sailing. Catherine Snell’s statement had made matters
easy so far. But there was a good deal more to be learnt,
a great deal to be sifted before the truth would be revealed.</p>

<p>When a person in Russia is suspected of crime, the law
gives the police tremendous power, and there are few of
the formalities to be gone through such as are peculiar to
our own country; and in this instance Danevitch was in a
position to do almost absolutely whatever he thought fit
and proper to do.</p>

<p>The finding of the glove carried conviction to his mind
that Anna Plevski was mixed up in this new plot for the
destruction of the Emperor. So, without any ceremony,
he proceeded to rummage her boxes and drawers for further
evidence. The want of keys did not deter him; chisels
and hammers answered the same purpose. His search was
rewarded with a bundle of letters. These were hastily
scanned; they were all, apparently, innocent enough; the
majority of them were love letters. A few of these were
signed ‘Peter Treskin’; the rest simply bore the initial ‘P.’
There was nothing in any of these letters calculated to
cause suspicion, with the exception of the following somewhat
obscure passage in a letter written a few days before
the explosion:</p>

<p>‘The time is at hand when your faith and love will be
put to a great test. The serious business we have in hand
is reaching a critical stage, and success depends on our
courage, coolness, and determination. You and I must
henceforth walk hand-in-hand to that supreme happiness
for which we have both toiled. We love each other. We
must unite our destinies in a bond that can only be severed
by death.’</p>

<p>Having learnt so much, Danevitch once more confronted
Anna. She confessed she had a lover named Peter Treskin;
they had quarrelled, however, and he had gone away; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
she knew not where he had gone to, and she did not care
if she never saw him again.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you will be able to remember things better in
a dungeon,’ suggested Danevitch, as he arrested Anna, and
handed her over to the care of a gendarme.</p>

<p>She turned deathly white, but otherwise appeared calm
and collected, and declared that she was the victim of a
gross outrage, for which everyone concerned would be made
to suffer.</p>

<p>Danevitch’s next move was to go to Treskin’s lodgings.
He found that gentleman had been absent for three days.
Here also a search was made for compromising papers. A
good many letters from Anna Plevski were brought to
light. They all breathed the most ardent love and devotion
for the man; and the writer declared that she could
not live a day without him, that for his sake she was
prepared to peril her soul. But there were other letters—love
letters—written to Treskin by a woman who signed
herself Lydia Zagarin. This person not only betrayed by
her writing that she was desperately, madly in love with
Treskin also, but from her statements and expressions it
was obvious that he had carried on an intrigue with her,
and was as much in love with her as she was with him.
She wrote from a place called Werro, in the Baltic
provinces. Danevitch took possession of these letters, and
continued his search, during which he came across a slip of
paper which bore the printed heading, ‘The Technical
School of Chemistry, St. Petersburg.’ On it was written
this line: ‘Yes, I think I shall succeed.—<span class="smcap">Smolski</span>.’</p>

<p>Apparently there was not much in this, but what there
was was quite enough for Danevitch under the circumstances,
and he had Professor Smolski arrested. It was a summary
proceeding, but in times of excitement in Russia anyone
may be arrested who may possibly turn out to be a guilty
person. It is not necessary that there should be a shadow
of a shade of evidence of guilt in the first instance; it is
enough that there is a possibility of the police being right.
But if they are wrong what does it matter? The person
is released, and the police are not blamed. Danevitch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
however, did not often go wrong in this respect; and in
this instance, Smolski being a Professor in the Technical
School of Chemistry, there were probabilities that he
might be able to afford some valuable information respecting
Treskin.</p>

<p>Smolski was one of those extraordinary types of men
who, having conceived a certain thing to be right, are
willing to risk fame, fortune, life itself, for the sake of their
opinions. Smolski was undoubtedly a gentle, high-minded
man; nevertheless he believed that the ruler of his country
was a tyrant; that his countrymen were little better than
slaves, whose social and political rights were ignored;
that the ordinary means—such as are familiar to more
liberally-governed countries—being useless to direct attention
to their wrongs, violent measures were justified, and
the removal of the tyrant would be acceptable in God’s
sight. Holding these views—and though he was a family
man and one respected and honoured—Smolski had allied
himself with a band of arch-conspirators, whose head was
Peter Treskin. He was calm, dignified, and collected
under his arrest, and when he was interrogated, in accordance
with Russian law, by a judge of instruction, he
frankly admitted that he had been concerned in an
attempt to bring about a better form of government; but
he steadfastly refused to denounce any of his accomplices.
He could die bravely, as became a man, but no one should
say he was a traitor.</p>

<p>All this would have been admirable in a nobler cause;
as it was, he simply proved that he had allowed his extreme
views to blind him to the difference between legitimate
constitutional agitation and crime—crime that, whether
committed in the name of politics or not, was murder, and
an outrage against God’s ordinance. Smolski, in common
with most men, neglected the safe rule that letters should
be destroyed when they are calculated to compromise one’s
honour or betray one’s friends. And thus it came about
that when the Professor’s papers were examined, not only
were Isaac and Jacob Eisenmann brought into the police
net, but many others; and in a diary he had kept there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
was a record of his experiments with the deadly compound
which was destined to blow the monarch of the Empire
into eternity, but which, owing to an accident or a blunder,
had failed in its object so far as the Czar was concerned,
though it had cruelly cut short the lives of many hard-working
and worthy men. Under any circumstances, even
if the Czar had been involved in the destructive influences
of the infernal machine, many others must have perished
with him. Such conspirators never hesitate to destroy
nine hundred and ninety-nine inoffensive people if they
can only reach the thousandth against whom they have a
grievance.</p>

<p>Piece by piece the whole story as set forth in the first
part of this chronicle was put together, and the plot laid
bare; but though many had been brought under the iron
grip of the law, the arch-conspirator, to whose ruling spirit
and genius the plot was due, was still at large, and no trace
of him was at that time forthcoming; but Danevitch did
not despair of hunting him down, of bringing him to his
doom. And no one whose mind was not distorted could
say his life was not forfeited. His whole career had been
one of plotting and deceit. His commanding presence
and masterful mind had given him such an influence over
many of those with whom he came in contact—especially
women—that he had proved himself more than ordinarily
dangerous, while his reckless and cowardly wickedness in
carrying the infernal machine on board the Czar’s yacht,
and thereby causing the sudden and cruel death of something
like two dozen people, stamped him at once as a
being against whom every honest man’s hand should be
raised.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while Danevitch was trying to get a
clue to Treskin’s whereabouts, his co-conspirators—they
might truly be described as his dupes—were tried, found
guilty, condemned, and executed. Smolski, the two Eisenmanns,
and four others, were ignominiously hanged in the
presence of an enormous crowd. Smolski met his end with
a perfect resignation, a calm indifference. He firmly
believed he was suffering in a good cause. He died with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
the words ‘Khrista radi’ (For Christ’s sake) upon his
lips. He posed as a martyr.</p>

<p>Anna Plevski had been cast for Siberia, but before starting
upon the terrible journey, the prospects of which were
more appalling than death, she would have to spend many
months in a noisome dungeon in the Russian Bastile,
Schlusselburgh, in Lake Ladoga.</p>

<p>But a circumstance presently arose which altered her
fate. Danevitch had kept his eye on Lydia Zagarin, of
Werro. He found she was the daughter of a retired ship-master,
who had purchased a little property in the small
and pleasantly-situated town of Werro. He was a
widower. Lydia was his only daughter. On her father’s
death she would succeed to a modest fortune. Treskin
had borrowed money from her, and it was probable that
he had singled her out from his many female acquaintances
as one to whom he would adhere on account of her money.
Four months after the fateful day when the Czar’s yacht
was partially destroyed and many people were killed,
Treskin wrote to this young woman, renewing his protestations
of regard for her, and asking her to send him money,
and to join him with a view to his marrying her. He
gave his address at Point de Galle, Ceylon, where, according
to his own account, he had started in business as a
merchant. He stated that, though he had taken no active
part in the destruction of the <i>North Star</i>, he happened to
be in Kronstadt on the night of the crime, and as he knew
he was suspected of being mixed up in revolutionary movements,
he deemed it advisable to go abroad; and so he
had bribed a boatman to convey him to a Swedish schooner
which was on the point of leaving the Kronstadt harbour
on the night of the explosion, and he bribed the captain
of the schooner to convey him to the coast of Sweden.
By this means he escaped. From Sweden he travelled to
England; from England to Ceylon, where he had a cousin
engaged on a coffee plantation.</p>

<p>This letter came into the hands of Danevitch before it
reached Lydia. How that was managed need not be
stated; but Danevitch now believed he saw his way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
capture Treskin. He knew, of course, that, as a political
refugee, claiming the protection of the British flag, he
could not be taken in the ordinary way. The British flag
has over and over again been disgraced by the protection
it has afforded to wretches of Treskin’s type, and it was so
in this instance. To obtain his extradition was next to
impossible. He was a wholesale murderer, but claimed
sanctuary in the name of politics, and he found this
sanctuary under the British flag.</p>

<p>Danevitch, however, resolved to have him, and resorted
to stratagem. He visited Anna Plevski in her dungeon.
She knew nothing at this time of the fate of her lover,
though she did know that he had not been captured.
Danevitch, by skill and artifice, aroused in her that
strongest of all female passions—jealousy. He began by
telling her that Treskin had deserted her in a cowardly
and shameful manner on the night of the crime, and did
not care whether she perished or lived. Then he laid
before her Lydia Zagarin’s letters to Treskin, which had
been seized at Treskin’s lodgings, and he watched the effect
on the girl as she read them. Finally he showed her the
letter sent from Ceylon.</p>

<p>That was the last straw. Her feelings burst from the
restraint she had tried to impose upon them, and she
cursed him again and again. She declared solemnly that
she was his victim; that she was innocent and loyal until
he corrupted her, and indoctrinated her with his revolutionary
ideas. He had sworn to be true to her, and used
to say they would live and die together. On the night of
the crime he had persuaded her to go with him to Kronstadt,
because he declared that he could not bear her to be out
of his sight. They had arranged that on the morrow they
were to quit St. Petersburg, and travel with all speed to
Austrian soil. But not only had he basely deceived her,
but treacherously deserted her. She was furious, and
uttered bitter regrets that she could not hope to be
revenged upon him.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind she was left for the time. A
week later, however, Danevitch once more visited her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
She was still brooding on her wrongs and her hard fate.
To suffer Siberia for the sake of a man who had so cruelly
deceived her and blighted her young life was doubly hard.</p>

<p>‘Would she be willing, if she had the chance, to bring
him to justice?’ Danevitch asked.</p>

<p>Her dark eyes filled with fire, and her pale face flushed,
as she exclaimed with passionate gesture that she would
do it with a fierce joy in her heart, and laugh at him
exultingly as he was led to his doom.</p>

<p>She was told that the chance would be given to her to
betray him into the hands of justice. She would be set
free on sufferance, and allowed to proceed to Ceylon, and,
provided she succeeded in her task and was faithful to the
trust reposed in her, she would, on returning to Russia,
receive a full pardon, and be supplied with a considerable
sum of money to enable her to live abroad if she
desired it.</p>

<p>In setting her free, however, in the first instance, the
Government intended to retain a hold upon her, and to
that end her youngest and favourite brother, who was an
invalid, and to whom she was devoted, had been arrested
on suspicion of being mixed up with revolutionary movements.
If she did not return within a fixed time, the
brother would be sent to the Siberian quicksilver-mines.
While she was away he would be treated with every kindness,
and on her return he would be set at liberty. His
fate therefore was in her hands. If she allowed the false
lover to prevail over her she would sacrifice her brother.
If, on the other hand, she was true to her trust, she would
save her brother, gratify her revenge, and be provided for
for life.</p>

<p>She was allowed a week in which to make up her mind;
but in two days she gave her decision. She would go to
Ceylon. She would lure Treskin to his doom. To prepare
the way she wrote a letter to dictation. In it she stated
that she had been tried and found not guilty. No sooner
was she released than she had been visited by a wretch of
a woman named Lydia Zagarin, who abused her fearfully
for having corresponded with Treskin, whom she claimed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
And in her mad passion she had disclosed his whereabouts,
but vowed that she hated him, knowing that he had been
false to her, and that all he wanted now was her money.
Anna, however, had no such thoughts about him. She
loved him to distraction, and could not live without him.
She intended, therefore, to go to Ceylon; and she had
managed to secure some money, which she would take to
him. She was perfectly sure, she added, that he loved her,
and that they would be very happy together.</p>

<p>This letter was duly despatched, and a fortnight later
Anna set out on her strange mission, having first had an
interview with her brother, though she was cautioned
against telling him or any living soul where she was going
to. She found him almost broken-hearted, for he declared
he was as innocent of revolutionary ideas as a babe unborn;
but he knew that when once a man fell into the hands of
the police as a ‘suspect’ he had very little to hope for.
Anna endeavoured to cheer him up by saying she would do
all that mortal could do to prove his innocence; and as
the Government had failed to substantiate their charge
against her, she was sure they would not succeed in his
case.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The scene changes again for the final act, and shows the
beautiful island of Ceylon and the wide, sweeping bay of
Point de Galle, with its splendid lighthouse, its great
barrier reef, and its golden sands. Anna Plevski had
landed there from a P. and O. steamer, and had been met
by Treskin, who, while he declared he was delighted to
see her, showed by his manner he was annoyed.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he hoped for Lydia Zagarin, but
Anna Plevski had come to him instead. But there was
another cause for his annoyance, as Anna soon discovered.
He had a native mistress; but in a little time Anna had
so far prevailed over him that he put the dusky beauty
away. He had commenced in business as a commission
agent and coffee merchant; but so far success had not
attended his efforts. He had neither the energy, the
perseverance, nor the patience necessary if one would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
succeed in business, so that he very eagerly inquired of
Anna what money she had brought. She told him that
she had not very much with her, but in a few weeks would
receive a remittance. In the meantime there was enough
to be going on with. She thus won his confidence. Indeed,
he never for a moment suspected her mission. There was
nothing whatever to arouse his suspicions. It all seemed
perfectly natural and he believed that under the ægis of
the British flag he was perfectly safe. So he would have
been if Danevitch had not played such a clever move to
checkmate him.</p>

<p>A little more than two months passed, during which
Treskin knew nothing of the sword that swung above his
head. Then Anna complained of illness. She thought
Point de Galle did not agree with her; she wanted a
change; she had been told that Colombo was a very pretty
place; she would like to see it; and as she had received
a remittance of thirty pounds they could afford the
journey. He must take her there. To this he consented,
and they travelled by gharry. It was the first step towards
his doom. With the remittance came another letter to
Anna giving her secret instructions.</p>

<p>Colombo was duly reached. It was the best season.
The days were tranquil and brilliant. The nights were
wordless poems. The third night after their arrival Anna
expressed a desire to go out in a native boat on the water.
The sea was motionless. It was like a sheet of glass. The
night was glorious; a soft land-breeze blew, laden with
rich scents. The heavens were ablaze with stars, and a
dreamy languor seemed to pervade the delicious atmosphere.
Accordingly, a native boat and two stalwart
rowers were hired, and Treskin and Anna embarked. It
was the second step towards his doom.</p>

<p>The boatmen pulled from the land. The calm water
and tranquil night made rowing easy, and presently a little
bamboo sail was hoisted, which helped the craft along.
Treskin lay back in the stern and smoked; Anna sat
beside him, and sang softly snatches of plaintive Russian
airs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>When about five miles from the shore, they saw a small
steamer creeping slowly along. She came close to the
boat, and an English voice hailed her and asked if anyone
in the boat spoke English.</p>

<p>Treskin answered. The voice then inquired if the
occupant of the boat would kindly take some letters on
shore. The captain of the steamer did not want to go
into the port.</p>

<p>Treskin gladly consented, and he was asked to order
his boatmen to pull alongside the steamer, which proved
to be a pleasure-yacht.</p>

<p>Without a shadow of suspicion in his mind, Treskin did
so, and he was politely invited to step on board, a ladder
being lowered for that purpose. He turned to Anna, and
asked her if she would go. Of course she would. So she
preceded him up the ladder.</p>

<p>As soon as he was on the deck the gangway was closed,
and a man in uniform directed him to the little saloon,
where some wine and biscuits stood on the table. The
engines of the steamer were started, though that did not
alarm him; but in a few minutes a stern, determined man
entered the cabin. He wore the uniform of a lieutenant
of the Russian Navy, and had a sword at his side.</p>

<p>‘Peter Treskin,’ he said in Russian, ‘you have been
cleverly lured on board this boat, which is owned by a
Russian gentleman, and flies the Russian flag, in order
that you may be taken back to Russia to answer for your
great crime.’</p>

<p>Treskin’s face turned to an ashen grayness, and, springing
to his feet, he rushed to the door, but found his exit barred
by armed men. In another instant he was seized, and
heavily ironed. He knew then that his fate was sealed,
and his heart turned to lead with an awful sense of
despair.</p>

<p>Steaming as hard as she could steam, the yacht rounded
Point de Galle, and when about fifteen miles due east of
Ceylon she suddenly stopped. A Russian gunboat was lying
in wait. To this gunboat the prisoner was transferred,
but Anna remained on board the yacht.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>The gunboat steamed away at once, and shaped her
course for Manilla, where she coaled; and that done she
proceeded under a full head of steam for the sea of Japan
and Vladivostock.</p>

<p>The yacht went in the other direction, making for the
Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, and after a pleasant and
uneventful voyage she sailed by way of the Bosphorus to
the Crimea. She made many calls on the way, and at
every port she touched at she was supposed to be on a
pleasure cruise, and Anna was looked upon as the owner’s
wife.</p>

<p>As Anna Plevski entered Russia in the west, her false
lover entered it in the far east, and thence under a strong
escort he was conducted through the whole length of
Siberia to St. Petersburg, a distance of something like
five thousand miles.</p>

<p>It is an awful journey at the best of times. In his
case the awfulness was enhanced a hundredfold, for he
knew that every verst travelled placed him nearer and
nearer to his shameful doom.</p>

<p>He was six months on the journey, and when he reached
the capital his hair was white, his face haggard and drawn,
his eyes sunken. He was an old and withered man, while
the terrible strain had affected his mind; but as he had
been pitiless to others, so no pity was shown for him. He
had brought sorrow, misery, and suffering to many a home.
He had made widows and orphans; he had maimed and
killed, and he could not expect mercy in a world which he
had disgraced.</p>


<h4>THE DÉNOUEMENT.</h4>

<p>It is a typical Russian winter day. The sun shines
from a cloudless sky. The air is thin and transparent,
the cold intense; the snow is compacted on the ground
until it is of the consistency of iron.</p>

<p>On the great plain outside of St. Petersburg, where the
public executions take place, a grim scaffold is erected. It
is an exposed platform of rough boards, from which spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
two upright posts, topped with a cross-bar, from which
depends a rope with a noose.</p>

<p>It is the most primitive arrangement. The scaffold is
surrounded with troops, horse and foot. There are nearly
two thousand of them; but the scaffold is raised so high
that the soldiers do not obscure the view.</p>

<p>The plain is filled with a densely-packed crowd; but on
one side a lane is kept open, and up this lane rumbles a
springless cart, guarded by horsemen with drawn swords.
In the cart, on a bed of straw, crouches a man, bound
hand and foot. His face is horrible—ghastly. It wears a
stony expression of concentrated fear.</p>

<p>A priest sits with the man, and holds a crucifix before
his eyes. But the eyes appear sightless, and to be starting
from the head.</p>

<p>The cart reaches the foot of the ladder which leads to
the platform. The bound man is dragged out, for he is
powerless to move. He is pushed and dragged up the
ladder, followed by the priest. As soon as he reaches the
platform and sees the noose, he utters a suppressed cry of
horror, and shrinks away.</p>

<p>Pitiless hands thrust him forward again, and he is placed
on some steps; the noose is adjusted round his neck. No
cap is used to hide his awful face. At a given signal the
steps are drawn away, and the man swings in the air and
is slowly strangled to death. A great cheer rises from the
crowd, but it is mingled with groans.</p>

<p>Thus did Peter Treskin meet his doom. He lived like
a coward; he died like a coward. He had talents and
abilities that, properly directed, would have gained him
high position, but he chose the wrong path, and it ended
in a dog’s death.</p>

<p>He well deserved his ignominious fate, and yet, even at
the present day, there are some who believe he was a
martyr. But these people may be classed amongst those
who believe not, even though an angel comes down from
heaven to teach.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CLUE OF THE DEAD HAND<br />


<small>THE STORY OF AN EDINBURGH MYSTERY</small></h2>


<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br />


<small>NEW YEAR’S EVE: THE MYSTERY BEGINS.</small></h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A strange</span>, weird sort of place was Corbie Hall. There
was an eeriness about it that was calculated to make one
shudder. For years it had been practically a ruin, and
tenantless.</p>

<p>Although an old place, it was without any particular
history, except a tradition that a favourite of Queen Mary
had once lived there, and suddenly disappeared in a
mysterious way. He was supposed to have been murdered
and buried secretly.</p>

<p>The last tenant was one Robert Crease, a wild roisterer,
who had travelled much beyond the seas, scraped money
together, purchased the Hall, surrounded himself with a
number of boon companions, and turned night into day.
Corbie Hall stood just to the north of Blackford Hill, as
those who are old enough will remember.</p>

<p>In ‘Rab’ Crease’s time it was a lonely enough place;
but he and his brother roisterers were not affected by the
solitude, and many were the curious tales told about their
orgies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>However, Rab came to grief one night. He had been
into the town for some purpose, and, staggering home in a
storm of wind and rain with a greater burden of liquor
than he could comfortably carry, he missed his way, pitched
headlong into a quarry, and broke his neck.</p>

<p>He left the place to a person whom he described as his
nephew. But the heir could not be found, nor could his
death be proved. Then litigation had ensued, and there
had been fierce wrangles; bitterness was engendered, and
bad blood made. The place, however, remained empty
and lonely year after year, until, as might have been
expected, it got an evil reputation. People said it was
haunted. They shunned it. The wildest possible stories
were told about it. It fell into dilapidation. The winter
rains and snows soaked through the roof. The window-frames
rotted; the grounds became a wilderness of weeds.</p>

<p>At last the heir was found. His name was Raymond
Balfour. He was the only son of Crease’s only sister, who
had married a ne’er-do-weel of a fellow, who came from no
one knew where, and where he went to no one cared. He
treated his wife shamefully.</p>

<p>Her son was born in Edinburgh, and when he was little
more than a baby she fled with him and obtained a
situation of some kind in Deeside. She managed to give
her boy a decent education, and he was sent to Edinburgh
to study law.</p>

<p>He seemed, however, to have inherited some of his
father’s bad qualities, and fell into disgrace. His mother
dying before he was quite out of his teens, he found himself
friendless and without resources.</p>

<p>His mother in marrying had alienated herself from her
relatives, what few she had; and when she died no one
seemed anxious to own kindredship with Raymond, whose
conduct and ‘goings on’ were described as ‘outrageous.’
So the young fellow snapped his fingers at everyone,
declared his intention of going out into the world to seek
his fortune, and disappeared.</p>

<p>After many years of wandering in all parts of the world,
and when in mid-life, he returned to Edinburgh, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
declared that, of all the cities he had seen, it was the most
beautiful, the most picturesque.</p>

<p>He was a stalwart, sunburnt, handsome fellow, though
with a somewhat moody expression and a cold, distant,
reserved manner. He had heard by mere chance of his
inheritance, and, having legally established his claim, took
possession of his property.</p>

<p>Although nobody could learn anything at all of his
affairs, it was soon made evident that he had plenty of
money. He brought with him from India, or somewhere
else, a native servant, who appeared to be devoted to him.
This servant was simply known as Chunda.</p>

<p>He was a strange, fragile-looking being, with restless,
dreamy eyes, thin, delicate hands, and a hairless, mobile
face, that was more like the face of a woman than a man.
Yet the strong light of the eyes, and somewhat square
chin, spoke of determination and a passionate nature.
When he first came he wore his native garb, which was
exceedingly picturesque; but in a very short time he donned
European clothes, and never walked abroad without a
topcoat on, even in what Edinburgh folk considered hot
weather.</p>

<p>When it became known that the wanderer had returned,
apparently a wealthy man, those who years before had
declared his conduct to be ‘outrageous,’ and declined to
own him, now showed a disposition to pay the most servile
homage.</p>

<p>But he would have none of them. It was his hour of
triumph, and he closed his doors against all who came to
claim kinship with him.</p>

<p>Very soon it was made manifest that Raymond Balfour
was in the way to distinguish himself as his predecessor
and kinsman, Crease, had done.</p>

<p>Corbie Hall was turned into a place of revel and riot,
and strange, even startling, were the stories that came into
currency by the vulgar lips of common rumour. Those
whose privilege it was to be the guests at Corbie Hall
were not people who, according to Edinburgh ethics, were
entitled to be classed amongst the elect, or who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
numbered within the pale of so-called ‘respectable society.’
They belonged rather to that outer fringe which was considered
to be an ungodly Bohemia.</p>

<p>It was true that in their ranks were certain young men
who were supposed to be seriously pursuing their studies
in order that they might ultimately qualify for the Church,
the Law, and Medicine.</p>

<p>But their chief sin, perhaps, was youth, which, as the
years advanced, would be overcome. Nevertheless, the
frowns of the ‘superior people’ were directed to them,
and they were solemnly warned that Corbie Hall was on
the highroad to perdition; that, as it had always been an
unlucky place, it would continue to be unlucky; in short,
that it was accursed.</p>

<p>Raymond Balfour’s guests were not all of the sterner
sex. Ladies occasionally graced his board. One of them
was a Maggie Stiven, who rejoiced in being referred to as
the best hated woman in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of a baker carrying on business
in the High Street; but Maggie had quarrelled with her
parents, and taken herself off to her only brother, who
kept a public-house in College Street.</p>

<p>He, too, had quarrelled with his people, so that he not
only welcomed Maggie, but was glad of her assistance in
his business.</p>

<p>Maggie bore the proud reputation of being the prettiest
young woman in Edinburgh. Her age was about three-and-twenty,
and it was said she had turned the heads of
half the young fellows in the town. She was generally
regarded as a heartless coquette, a silly flirt, who had brains
for nothing else but dress.</p>

<p>She possessed a will of her own, however, and seemed
determined to shape her course and order her life exactly
as it pleased her to do.</p>

<p>She used to say that, if ‘the grand folk’ turned up their
noses at her, she knew how to turn up her nose at them.</p>

<p>When she found out that a rumour was being bandied
from lip to lip, which coupled her name with the name of
Raymond Balfour—in short, that he and she were engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
to be married—she was intensely delighted; but, while she
did not deny it, she would not admit it. It was only in
accordance with human nature that some spiteful things
should be said.</p>

<p>‘It’s no for his guid looks nor his moral character that
Maggie Stiven’s fastening herself on to the reprobate of
Corbie Hall,’ was the sneering comment. ‘It’s his siller
she’s thinking of. She’s aye ready to sell her body and
soul for siller. Well, when he’s married on to her he’ll
sune find that it taks mair than a winsome face tae make
happiness. But fules will aye be fules, and he maun gang
his ain way.’</p>

<p>It is pretty certain that Maggie was not affected by this
sort of tittle-tattle. She knew the power of her ‘winsome
face,’ and made the most of it. She knew also that the
scathing things that were said about her came from her
own sex.</p>

<p>She could twist men round her little finger. They
were her slaves. That is where her triumph came in.
She could make women mad, and bring men to their
knees.</p>

<p>Whether or not there was any truth in the rumour at
this time, that she was likely to wed the master of Corbie
Hall, there was no doubt at all that she was a frequent
visitor there.</p>

<p>Sometimes she went with her brother, who supplied
most of the liquor consumed in the Hall—and it was a
pretty good source of income to him—and sometimes she
went alone.</p>

<p>Scarcely a night passed that Mr. Balfour was without
company; and Maggie was often there three or four nights
a week. She had even been seen driving about with him
in his dogcart.</p>

<p>It seemed, therefore, as if there was some justification
for the surmise as to the probable match and the ultimate
wedding.</p>

<p>These preliminary particulars about Maggie and the
new owner of Corbie Hall will pave the way to the series
of extraordinary events that has now to be described.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>It was New Year’s Eve. Raymond Balfour had then
been in possession of his property for something like nine
months, and during that period had made the most of his
time.</p>

<p>He had gone the pace, as the saying is; and the old
house, after years of mouldiness and decay, echoed the
shouts of revelry night after night. There were wild
doings there, and sedate people were shocked.</p>

<p>On the New Year’s Eve in question there was a pretty
big party in the Hall. During the week following
Christmas, large stores of supplies had been sent out
from the town in readiness for the great feast that was
to usher in the New Year.</p>

<p>Some fifteen guests assembled in the house altogether,
including Maggie Stiven and four other ladies, and in
order to minister to the wants of this motley crowd, three
or four special waiters were engaged to come from Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The day had been an unusually stormy one. A terrific
gale had lashed the Firth, and there had been much loss
of life and many wrecks. The full force of the storm was
felt in Edinburgh, and numerous accidents had occurred
through the falling of chimney-cans and pots. Windows
were blown in, hoardings swept away, and trees uprooted
as if they had been mere saplings.</p>

<p>The wind was accompanied by hail and snow, while the
temperature was so low that three or four homeless, starving
wretches were found frozen to death.</p>

<p>As darkness set in the wind abated, but snow then began
to fall, and in the course of two or three hours roads and
railways were blocked, and the streets of the city could
only be traversed with the greatest difficulty. Indeed, by
seven o’clock all vehicular traffic had ceased, and benighted
wayfarers despaired of reaching their homes in safety.</p>

<p>The storm, the darkness, the severity of the weather,
the falling snow, did not affect the spirits nor the physical
comfort of the guests assembled at Corbie Hall.</p>

<p>To the south of Edinburgh the snow seemed to fall
heavier than it did in the city itself. In exposed places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
it lay in immense drifts, but everywhere it was so deep
that the country roads were obliterated, landmarks wiped
out, and hedges buried.</p>

<p>In the lonely region of Blackford Hill, Corbie Hall was
the only place that gave forth any signs of human life.
Light and warmth were there, and the lights streaming
from the windows must have shone forth as beacons of
hope to anyone in the neighbourhood who might by chance
have been battling with the storm and struggling to a
place of safety.</p>

<p>But no one was likely to be abroad on such a night;
and the guests at the Hall, when they saw the turn the
weather had taken, knew that they would be storm-stayed
at the Hall until the full light of day returned. But that
prospect did not concern them.</p>

<p>They were there to see the old year out and the new
one in; and so long as the ‘meal and the malt’ did not
fail they would be in no hurry to go.</p>

<p>From all the evidence that was collected, they were a
wild party, and did full justice to the stock of eatables
and drinkables—especially the drinkables—that were so
lavishly supplied by the host.</p>

<p>When twelve o’clock struck there was a scene of wild
uproar, and everyone who was sober enough to do so
toasted his neighbour. During the whole of the evening
Balfour had openly displayed great partiality for Maggie
Stiven.</p>

<p>He insisted on her sitting next to him, and he paid her
marked attention. When the company staggered to their
feet to usher in the new year, Raymond Balfour flung his
arms suddenly round her neck, and, kissing her with great
warmth, he droned out a stanza of a love-ditty, and then
in husky tones exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘Maggie Stiven’s the bonniest lass that ever lived, and
I’m going to marry her.’</p>

<p>About half-past one only a few of the roisterers were
left at the table. The others had succumbed to the too-seductive
influences of the wine and whisky, and had
ceased to take any further interest in the proceedings.
Suddenly there resounded through the house a shrill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
piercing scream. It was a scream that seemed to indicate
intense horror and great agony.</p>

<p>Consternation and silence fell upon all who heard it.
In a few moments Raymond Balfour rose to his feet and
said:</p>

<p>‘Don’t be alarmed. Sit still. I’ll go and see what’s
the matter.’</p>

<p>He left the room with unsteady gait, and nobody showed
any disposition to follow him. Something like a superstitious
awe had taken possession of the revellers, and they
conversed with each other subduedly.</p>

<p>Amongst them was a tough, bronzed seafaring man,
named Jasper Jarvis. He was captain of the barque
<i>Bonnie Scotland</i>, which had arrived at Leith a few weeks
before from the Gold Coast with a cargo of palm-oil and
ivory.</p>

<p>Jarvis, who seems to have been quite in his sober senses,
got up, threw an extra log on the fire, and in order to put
heart into his companions, began to troll out a nautical
ditty; but it had not the inspiriting effect that he expected,
and somebody timidly suggested that he should go in search
of the host.</p>

<p>To this he readily assented, but before he could get
from his seat, Maggie Stiven jumped up and exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘You people all stay here. I’ll go and look for
Raymond.’</p>

<p>Captain Jarvis offered no objection, and no one else
interposed, so Maggie hurriedly left the room. From this
point the narrative of what followed can best be told in
the skipper’s own words.</p>


<p class="ph1">THE STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN JASPER JARVIS.</p>

<p>When Maggie had gone we were six all told. The four
ladies had previously gone to bed. Two out of the six were
so muddled that they seemed incapable of understanding
anything that was going on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>The other three appeared to be under the spell of fear.
They huddled together round the fire, and all became
silent.</p>

<p>It is curious that they should have been so affected by
the scream; and yet, perhaps, it wasn’t, for somehow or
other it didn’t seem natural at all. But the fact is, we
had all been so jolly and happy, and the cry broke in
upon us so suddenly, that it impressed us more than it
would have done otherwise.</p>

<p>And then another thing was, it was difficult to tell
whether it was a woman or a man who had screamed. It
was too shrill for a man’s cry, and yet it wasn’t like the
scream of a woman.</p>

<p>When Maggie Stiven had been gone about ten minutes—it
seemed much longer than that to us—Rab Thomson,
who was one of three men who sat by the fire, looked at
me with white face, and said:</p>

<p>‘Skipper, you go and look after them. I don’t feel
easy in my mind. I’ve a sort of feeling something queer
has happened.’</p>

<p>On that I rose, saying I would soon find out, and went
to the door. As I opened it I heard a sigh, and then a
sort of prolonged groan, and I saw, or fancied I saw, a
shadowy figure flit up the stair.</p>

<p>The hall was in darkness, save for the light that fell
through the doorway as I held the door partly open. I’m
ashamed to say it, but when I saw—if I did see it—that
ghostly figure glide up the stairs, and heard the sigh and
the groan, I shut the door quickly and drew back into the
room.</p>

<p>Like most sailor men, I’m not without some belief in
signs, omens, wraiths, and those kind of things; though
nobody can say, and nobody must say, I’m wanting in
pluck.</p>

<p>I’ve been at sea for thirty-two years, and during that
time I’ve faced death in a thousand forms, and never had
any feeling of fear. But, to be straight, I don’t like anything
that’s uncanny. I like to be able to get a grip of
things, and to understand them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>When I started back into the room, Rab Thomson rose
to his feet and asked me what I’d seen. I told him I had
seen a shadowy figure glide up the stairs, and had heard a
sigh and a groan.</p>

<p>He laughed, but it wasn’t a real kind of laugh. He
was as white as death, and I heard his teeth chatter, and
with a sudden movement he went to one of the long
windows, pulled aside the heavy curtain, and, pressing his
face to the glass, peered out.</p>

<p>I think his intention was to get out of the window and
go home; but he saw what an awful night it was. The
snow was still falling heavily; it was piled up against the
window, and no one but a madman or a fool would have
dreamed of going forth in such a storm, for it was all but
certain he would have lost his life in the drifts.</p>

<p>Rab let the curtain fall, and, drawing back, filled
himself a measure of whisky, and, tossing it off, said
to me:</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you go and see what’s the matter, man?
Surely, you are no’ frightened?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ I said, ‘but you are.’</p>

<p>And I walked to the door again, flung it open wide, so
that the light streamed forth, and as I did so I saw a
woman lying huddled up on the mat at the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>I recognised her at once by the dress, which was a kind
of pink silk, with a lot of fluffy lace all round the neck
part of it, as Maggie Stiven, and, thinking she had fainted,
I rushed forward, lifted her up with ease—for I am a powerful
man, and she was a lightly-built little woman—and
carried her to a big chair that stood empty near the fire.
As I put her in the chair I noticed that her head fell
forward on to her bosom with a strange kind of limpness,
and her face was of a greenish, chalky kind of hue.</p>

<p>I felt frightened, and called out to the others to rouse
up James Macfarlane, who had been studying medicine,
but had nearly finished his course, and expected to get
his diploma the next session.</p>

<p>Jamie had stowed away too much liquor in his hold in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
the early part of the evening, and had foundered, so somebody
had rolled him up in a rug and put him on a couch,
where he had been sleeping for hours. Notwithstanding
that fact, it took a long time to waken him.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile I chafed Maggie’s hand, and Rab
tried to get brandy down her throat, but it flowed out of
her mouth again.</p>

<p>When James Macfarlane realized that something was
wrong, he pulled himself together at once, and having felt
Maggie’s pulse, he exclaimed with a horrified expression
on his face:</p>

<p>‘My God, boys, she’s dead!’</p>

<p>This was only a confirmation of my own fears; nevertheless,
the definite assertion by one who was qualified to
tell was an awful shock to us.</p>

<p>A little more than a quarter of an hour before, Maggie,
radiant with health and spirits, and looking very bonnie—she
was one of the prettiest girls I think I’ve ever seen—had
run out of the room; and now she was there in the
chair, dead.</p>

<p>At Macfarlane’s suggestion we laid her flat on her back
on the rug before the fire, and he tried to force a little
brandy down her throat, but failed; and as he rose to his
feet again, he said sadly:</p>

<p>‘There’s no mistake about it, boys: she’s dead as a
herring.’</p>

<p>Our first thought now was of our host. What had
become of him? I and Rab, who had recovered from his
fright by this time, undertook to go in search of him.
We lit the swinging lamp in the hall, and, taking candles
with us, went upstairs to his room; but he was not there,
and there were no signs of his having been there. Then
we went to the room of the black fellow, Chunda.</p>

<p>The door was locked, and we had to shake and hammer
it pretty hard before we roused him up. As he opened
the door and stood before us in his night-clothes, he
looked dazed, as one does when just wakened from sound
sleep.</p>

<p>He did not speak English, but I could manage a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
Hindustani, having been much in India, and I asked him
if he had seen his master lately, and he answered ‘No.’ I
told him he must come with me and look for him, as he
knew the run of the house better than I did.</p>

<p>He only stopped to slip on some of his clothes and wrap
a heavy rug round his shoulders, for he felt the cold very
much.</p>

<p>Then we roused up the other three house-servants and the
temporary servants, who had retired soon after midnight,
and we went from room to room, passage to passage; in
fact, we searched the house from top to bottom, but all in
vain; not a trace of our friend could we get.</p>

<p>Our next step was to ascertain if he had gone out. But
all the doors and windows were fastened. Nevertheless, I
undertook to search the grounds, and, having been provided
with a horn lantern, we got the big hall door
opened; but the snow had drifted against it to such an
extent that a great mass of it fell into the hall.</p>

<p>The night was pitch-dark, the air thick with snow. I
made some attempt to go forth, but sank up to my waist,
and was forced to return.</p>

<p>We then tried the back of the house, where there was a
stable-yard. The snow was pretty heavy there, but not so
heavy as in the front. Two men slept over the stable. I
roused them up, got the keys of the stable, and went in.
Balfour kept three horses, and they were in their stalls all
right.</p>

<p>The stable-yard gate was barred, and it was very clear
no one had been out that way.</p>

<p>I returned to the house, half frozen and very depressed.
We then consulted together, and decided that nothing
could be done until daylight.</p>

<p>It was an awful ending to our merry meeting, and the
mystery of the whole affair weighed upon us like a nightmare.</p>

<p>The ladies of our party, who had gone to bed soon after
we had drunk in the New Year, got up and dressed themselves.
In the meantime we carried Maggie Stiven’s body
into another room, where it was laid out on a table.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
James Macfarlane’s opinion was that she had died from a
sudden shock of fright; and when that was taken in connection
with the eldritch scream which had so startled us,
and the mysterious disappearance of our host, we felt that
there was something uncanny about the whole business.</p>

<p>The rest of the night was wearily passed. The others
of our party, having been o’er fu’ when they went to sleep,
continued to sleep through it all, and knew nothing of the
tragic ending until they awoke in the morning.</p>

<p>With the coming of the morning our spirits revived a
little, though we still felt miserable enough. It had
almost ceased to snow, but the whole country was buried,
and round about the house the drift was piled up until it
reached to the lower windows.</p>

<p>As soon as it was broad daylight we made another careful
search of the house, but not a sign of Raymond
Balfour could we see.</p>

<p>Chunda helped us in our search. He was terribly cut
up, and became so ill from grief and the cold that he was
obliged to go to bed.</p>

<p>The only reasonable theory that we could find to
account for Balfour’s strange disappearance was that, by
some means we could not determine, he had managed to
leave the house, and had perished in the snow.</p>

<p>As it had continued to snow all night, and at eight
o’clock was still falling lightly, all traces were, of course,
obliterated.</p>

<p>Every one of the visitors was now anxious to get away,
but before anyone went, I drew up a statement which was
duly signed. James Macfarlane and I then undertook to
report the matter to the police in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Before any of us could leave, we had to clear the snow
away from the door and dig a path out. And even then
it was no easy matter to get clear.</p>

<p>We were a sorrowful enough party, as may be imagined,
and we all felt that the New Year had commenced badly
for us.</p>

<p>The death of Maggie Stiven was a terrible business, and
I confess to feeling surprised that she should have died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
from fright, for she was by no means a nervous girl.
Indeed, I think she was as plucky as any woman I have
ever known, and I was certain that if fright had really
killed her she must have seen something very awful.</p>

<p>With reference to this, nobody, I think, liked to put
his thoughts into words, but somehow we seemed to
divine that each believed Satan had spirited Raymond
Balfour away and frightened poor Maggie to death. Any
way, the mystery was beyond our solving, and we were
silent and melancholy as we straggled into Edinburgh,
where armies of labourers were busy clearing the streets
of snow.</p>

<p>It was an awful day. The cold was intense, and overhead
the sky was like one vast sheet of lead. Except the
labourers, few people were abroad, and those few looked
pinched up, draggled, and miserable.</p>

<p>God knows, we were miserable enough ourselves! I
know that my heart was like a stone; for I was not so
wanting in sense as not to see that trouble was bound to
come out of the business, and I fairly shuddered when I
thought of poor Balfour’s end, for it seemed impossible to
hope that he was still alive.</p>

<p>Look at the matter whichever way I would, it was a
mystery which absolutely appalled me, and it had all come
about with such awful suddenness that, speaking for myself,
I felt stunned.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />


<small>THE MYSTERY DEEPENS.—THE NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY<br />
PETER BRODIE, OF THE DETECTIVE SERVICE.</small></h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> in Liverpool, engaged on a rather delicate matter,
when I received a telegram from the chief of the police in
Edinburgh, telling me to return by the next train. I
wasn’t at all pleased by this recall, for it was wretched
weather, and the prospect of a night journey to the North
was far from agreeable.</p>

<p>The date was January 3. During the whole of New
Year’s Eve there had been a violent storm, which seems to
have been general all over the country. The result was a
breakdown of telegraph-wires and serious interruption to
traffic.</p>

<p>The telegram sent to me was five hours on the road;
and as the ‘next train’ meant the night mail, I had no
alternative but to bundle my traps together and start.</p>

<p>When we reached Carlisle a thaw had set in, and on
arriving at Edinburgh I thought I had never seen Auld
Reekie look so glum and dour. The streets were ankle-deep
in slush.</p>

<p>Snow was slipping from the roofs everywhere in
avalanches, necessitating considerable wariness on the
part of pedestrians.</p>

<p>Horses panted, groaned, and steamed as they toiled
with their loads through the filthy snow, and overhead
the sky hung like a dun pall.</p>

<p>On reaching the head office, I was at once instructed
to proceed to Corbie Hall to investigate a case of murder,
and endeavour to trace the whereabouts of one Raymond
Balfour, who, according to the statement of a Captain
Jasper Jarvis, corroborated by James Macfarlane, medical
student at the Edinburgh College, had mysteriously disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
soon after midnight on January 1. The remarkably
sudden and unaccountable death of Maggie
Stiven necessitated a legal inquiry, and Dr. Wallace Bruce
was sent to examine the body and report on the cause
of death.</p>

<p>On removing the clothes, he noticed that the linen that
had been next to the chest was slightly blood-stained, and
an examination revealed a very small blue puncture,
slightly to the left of the sternum, and immediately over
the heart.</p>

<p>On probing this puncture with his finger, he felt something
hard. He therefore proceeded to open the chest,
assisted by a colleague, Dr. James Simpson, the well-known
Edinburgh surgeon. To their astonishment, they
found the puncture was due to a thrust from a very fine
stiletto, which had pierced the heart on the left side.
The stiletto had broken off, and four inches of the steel
remained in the wound. This, acting as a plug, had
prevented outward bleeding to any extent, but there had
been extensive internal hæmorrhage. There was nothing
else to account for death.</p>

<p>The girl was exceedingly well developed, well nourished,
and without any sign or trace of organic disease. As she
could not have driven the stiletto into her chest in such
a way herself, it was obviously a case of murder.</p>

<p>When I reached Corbie Hall, the country round about
was still white with snow, and Blackford Hill was like
a miniature Alp, although the thaw was making its
influence felt.</p>

<p>The Hall was a curious, rambling sort of place, with
every appearance of age. It was a stone building, flanked
by a small turreted tower at each end. It stood in about
an acre of ground that was partly walled and partly fenced
round. Two cast-iron gates of good design, hung on
pillars, each surmounted by a carved greyhound, admitted
to a carriage-drive that swept in a semicircle to the main
entrance.</p>

<p>Passing through the doorway—the door itself was a
massive structure—I found myself in a large square, paved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
hall, and immediately in front a broad flight of oak stairs
led up to the first landing, where there was a very fine
stained-glass window.</p>

<p>On the left was a long dining-room, which communicated
by means of folding doors with another room of almost
equal dimensions.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the passage, and close to the
foot of the stairs, was the door of the drawing-room, which
was a counterpart almost of the dining-room.</p>

<p>Between the banisters of the stairs and the partition
wall of the dining-room, the passage was continued to
a door that gave access to a passage communicating with
the kitchen and back premises.</p>

<p>The recess underneath the stairs was used for hanging
up coats, hats, and other things. From the second landing
the stairs struck off at an acute angle, and rose to the
second story, where there were at least a dozen rooms,
large and small.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of Chunda, the black servant, who
seemed very ill and much depressed, I made a thorough
inspection of the house. As he could not speak English,
we had to communicate in signs, which was rather awkward.
In addition to this Indian, Mr. Balfour had kept a cook
and a small girl to help her, also a housemaid. Besides
these, he employed a groom and a coachman. The coachman
lived over the stables at the back with his wife and
daughter, a girl of eighteen, and she and her mother both
assisted in the house when necessary. The groom had a
room to himself above the coach-house.</p>

<p>I questioned each of these servants individually and
apart from the others as to whether they had heard the
scream alluded to by Captain Jarvis. The three women
living in the house said that they heard it, but those who
lived over the stables did not. The ones who heard it
slept in the right-hand tower. They did not retire until
after the New Year had come in. Although the master
had given them some hot drink, they were quite sober
when they went upstairs.</p>

<p>As they were in the habit of doing every night, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
extinguished the hall lamp and a lamp that stood on the
bracket at the top of the stairs, thus leaving that part
of the house in darkness. They did not attach any importance
to the scream, as they thought it was some of
the visitors larking, for they had all been very frisky
during the evening.</p>

<p>The cook, however—her name was Mary Kenway—opened
her door, which commanded in perspective a full
view of the corridor leading to the top of the stairs, and
she saw, or thought she saw, a shadowy figure standing
in this corridor near the top of the stairs. Feeling a bit
nervous, she shut the door hurriedly, and said to her
fellow-servants, who shared the room with her:</p>

<p>‘One of those fools is playing at ghosts or something.
Well, when the wine’s in, the wit’s out.’</p>

<p>She and her companions then got into bed, and some
time afterwards were startled by a loud knocking at their
door. The cook hurriedly procured a light, and on asking
who was there, and being informed it was Captain Jarvis,
and that he was searching for the master, who had disappeared,
she slipped on her clothes and opened the door.</p>

<p>The temporary servants, of whom there were three, were
sleeping in a room above her. They had indulged somewhat
too freely, and it was a considerable time before they
could be made to understand that something dreadful had
happened.</p>

<p>With these details, and the statement of Captain Jarvis,
I felt I was in a position to begin my researches.</p>

<p>If Captain Jarvis’s statement was true, and there wasn’t
the slightest reason to doubt it, for it was in the main
corroborated by Robert Thomson and others, the whole
affair was shrouded in considerable mystery. Indeed, I
think it was one of the strangest cases I ever had to do
with. Maggie Stiven had been foully done to death by
some subtle, deft, and treacherous assassin. She had been
struck with great force, and the breaking of the weapon
showed the fury with which her murderer had done his
damnable work.</p>

<p>The skipper’s statement that when he opened the dining-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
door he heard a sigh and sort of groan was compatible
with the nature of the wound, for though the
heart was injured, the fact of the piece of steel remaining
in the wound would prevent a sudden emptying of the
heart, and she might have lived after being struck five
to ten minutes. The shadowy figure which Jarvis said
he saw ‘gliding’ up the stairs was no doubt the assassin,
although Jarvis—his imagination having been fired—thought
it a supernatural appearance.</p>

<p>The cook also spoke of ‘a shadowy figure,’ and thought
that some of the guests were ‘playing at ghosts.’ This
independent testimony suggested that there was something
curious and out of the common about the figure, and I
was led to infer that the person who had done the deed
was small, light of foot, and agile of movement. When
he struck Maggie down he had probably been lurking in
the drawing-room, the door of which, as I have already
described, was just at the foot of the stairs, or he may
have been concealed in the recess under the stairs. Whichever
way it was, the girl had not mounted the stairs, and
must have been stabbed the moment she reached the mat
where the body was found, and before she had time to
get her feet on the stairs to go up.</p>

<p>Now came the question, Why was she killed? Her going
in search of Raymond Balfour was quite unpremeditated,
and the assassin could hardly have known that she was
coming out of the room.</p>

<p>Why, then, did he kill her? On the face of it, it
seemed to be an unprovoked and brutal crime without any
reason. But a little pondering, and a careful weighing of
all the pros and cons, led me to the conclusion that the
deed was not as purposeless as it seemed. If it was the
result of madness, there was certainly method in the
madness.</p>

<p>Some people expressed the opinion that Balfour himself
had murdered the girl, but that opinion would not hold
water.</p>

<p>Firstly, he himself was induced to leave the room by a
scream or cry that was described as ‘uncanny.’ Did he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
arrange for that cry to be uttered in order that he might
have an excuse for going out, knowing that the girl would
follow him?</p>

<p>Secondly, if he was the slayer, why did he choose to kill
the girl in his own house? for very little reflection must
have shown him that to escape detection would be an
impossibility.</p>

<p>No. It was only too evident that he did not kill
Maggie Stiven, and his extraordinary disappearance led
me to believe that he also had fallen a victim to the
assassin. But if that was so, where was his body? It
was, of course, of the highest importance that he should
be discovered, dead or alive.</p>

<p>I caused a search to be made of the house from top to
bottom. There wasn’t a room missed, not a cupboard
overlooked, not a recess but what was scrutinized. Every
box or trunk large enough to contain a man’s body was
opened without result.</p>

<p>Every hole and corner, every chimney, every likely and
unlikely place, was examined, but not a trace, not a sign, of
the missing man was brought to light.</p>

<p>His bedroom was the largest and most important room
in the house. It was panelled with dark oak panelling.
The ceiling was carved wood, and there was a very large
carved oak mantelpiece, which was considered a work of
art. Two lattice-paned windows were in keeping with the
place, which had also been furnished with a view to its
character.</p>

<p>A massive four-post bedstead occupied one corner, and
near it was an unusually large clothes-press of oak. This
press was spacious enough to have held the bodies of three
or four men, but Balfour’s body was not there.</p>

<p>From this room a small door gave access to a short,
narrow passage, leading to another door at the foot of a
stone staircase of about twenty steps, by which the top of
the tower at that end of the building was gained. From
the roof of the tower a very beautiful view was obtained.
I need scarcely say I critically examined the doors, the
passage, the stairs, the tower itself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>The locks of both doors were very rusty, and it was
evident they had not been opened for some time. In the
one at the foot of the tower stairs there was no key, and it
was only after considerable search that one was found to
fit it. And even then the lock could not be turned until
it had been well oiled.</p>

<p>The dust on the stone stairs was the accumulation of
months, and bore not the faintest trace of footprints. It
was obvious that no one had passed that way for a very
long time.</p>

<p>Having thus exhausted the interior of the building, I
now proceeded to search outside.</p>

<p>Skipper Jarvis declared that, when he and Bob Thomson
went through the house on the night of the tragedy, they
looked to every door and window, but all were properly
secured, and unless Balfour had squeezed himself through
a keyhole or a cranny, he could not have left the building.
Nevertheless, it seemed to me that the man must have got
out in some way; otherwise, if he were dead, how was it
we had failed to find his body in the house? So thorough
had been the search that a dead mouse could not have
escaped me.</p>

<p>There was still a great deal of snow on the ground,
especially in the hollows and ravines; but it was soft and
slushy owing to the rise in temperature.</p>

<p>Aided by half a dozen men—mostly gamekeepers—and
several dogs, we commenced systematically to examine the
grounds, the country round about, the burns, the woods,
but all to no purpose. Every inch of Braid Glen was gone
over; what is now the Waverley curling pond was dragged;
the Jordan and Braid streams examined; all the quarries
in the neighbourhood—of which there are many—were
looked into; the Braid Hill and all round about the Braid
Hill was paced; but the result was the same. Raymond
Balfour was not found.</p>

<p>When our failure became known, the excitement increased
greatly, especially amongst ignorant and stupid
people, who stoutly maintained that the master of Corbie
Hall had been spirited away by the Evil One, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
also killed Maggie Stiven. These good folks failed to
explain why the Evil One should have stabbed Maggie
with a stiletto, and have left more than half the blade
in the wound, when he might have deprived her of life so
much more easily. I found that even Captain Jarvis was
not without some belief in this absurd theory.</p>

<p>‘If there is not something uncanny about the whole
business, how is it you have failed to get trace of the
man?’ asked Jarvis, with the air of one who felt he was
putting a poser which was absolutely unanswerable. ‘You
see,’ pursued the skipper, with an insistency of tone that
was very amusing—‘you see, we were a bad lot. We’d
just come there for an orgie, and the meat and drink that
we wasted would have kept many poor wretches from
starving on that awful night.’</p>

<p>‘Do you consider that Raymond Balfour was an exceptionally
wicked man?’ I asked Jarvis.</p>

<p>‘Well, no,’ he answered seriously; ‘I shouldn’t like to
say that. But he was a wild fellow.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by wild?’</p>

<p>‘Well, he was a little too fond of liquor and the
ladies.’</p>

<p>‘Have you known him long?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, several years. I first met him in Madras. I saw
a good deal of him later in Calcutta. He was a very wild
boy then, I can tell you.’</p>

<p>‘But still no worse than tens of thousands of other
people?’ I suggested.</p>

<p>‘Oh no; I don’t say he was,’ Jarvis answered quickly,
and in a way that suggested he was anxious his friend
should not be painted too black.</p>

<p>‘Now, I want you to tell me this, Captain Jarvis,’ I said
somewhat solemnly, as I wished to impress him with the
importance of the question: ‘was there any love-making
between Raymond Balfour and Maggie Stiven?’</p>

<p>The skipper did not answer immediately. He seemed
to be revolving the matter in his mind. Then, with a
thoughtful stroking of his chin, he replied:</p>

<p>‘Balfour was fond of Maggie.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>‘Did he allow that fondness to display itself before
others?’</p>

<p>‘When he was a bit gone in his cups he did,’ answered
the captain, with obvious reluctance.</p>

<p>‘And was she fond of him?’</p>

<p>‘Yes—I think so’—the same reluctance showing itself.</p>

<p>‘Did she show her partiality?’</p>

<p>‘Sometimes.’</p>

<p>‘Maggie wasn’t considered to be very stanch to anyone,
was she?’</p>

<p>‘Well, she’d a good many admirers. She was an awful
good-looking lass, you see. And lads will always run after
a pretty girl.’</p>

<p>‘That scarcely answers my question, captain,’ I said.
‘I want to know if she openly—that is, before others—showed
that she liked Balfour better than any other body?’</p>

<p>‘You see, Mr. Brodie, I’m not altogether competent to
answer that,’ said the skipper, as though he was anxious
to shirk the question.</p>

<p>‘But did she do so on the New Year’s Eve, when you
were all so jovial?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘How did she display her liking?’</p>

<p>‘She sat on his knee several times. She kissed him, and
he kissed her.’</p>

<p>‘That was before the company?’</p>

<p>‘It was.’</p>

<p>‘Did he make any remark, or did she? I mean, any
remark calculated to engender a belief that this spooning
was serious, and not a mere flirtation, the result of a
spree?’</p>

<p>‘Well—I—I heard him say two or three times, “Mag,
old girl, I’m going to marry you.”’</p>

<p>‘He had been drinking then, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘He had, a good deal.’</p>

<p>‘And what did she reply?’</p>

<p>‘As near as I mind, she said, “All right, old man.
We are just suited to each other, and we’ll make a match
of it.”’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>‘I must now ask you one or two other questions,
captain. There were several men present, were there
not?’</p>

<p>‘There were.’</p>

<p>‘They were all young men?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘And belonged to Edinburgh or its immediate neighbourhood?’</p>

<p>‘They did.’</p>

<p>‘Consequently they were all more or less well acquainted
with Maggie?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. I don’t think there was a man there who didn’t
ken her. You see, in her way she was a kind of celebrity
in Edinburgh. Certain folk said hard things about her,
and that made her mad sometimes, so that she took a
delight in just showing how she could lead the lads by
the nose.’</p>

<p>‘Now, I want you to give me an answer to this question,
captain. Is it within your knowledge that out
of her many admirers there was one who had been
emboldened by her to think that he had the best claim
upon her?’</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t say for certain; but it’s likely enough.’</p>

<p>‘Has it occurred to you to ask yourself if that favoured
one was among Raymond Balfour’s guests on New Year’s
Eve?’</p>

<p>The question seemed to startle Captain Jarvis. He
looked at me searchingly and inquiringly, and it was
some moments before he spoke, while his expression gave
every indication that he fully understood the drift of
my inquiry. At last he replied, hesitatingly and cautiously:</p>

<p>‘You see, Mr. Brodie, I wasn’t the keeper of Maggie’s
conscience. She didn’t make me her confidant. Nor was
I one of her favoured suitors. I’m an old married man,
and she preferred young fellows.’</p>

<p>‘You’ve avoided my question now,’ I remarked, a
little sharply, as it seemed to me he was prevaricating.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>‘I’m trying to think,’ he said, with a preoccupied air.
Then, after a pause, he added: ‘I can’t answer you,
because I don’t know. What your question suggests is that
some chap who was madly jealous of her murdered her.’</p>

<p>‘You are correct in your surmise,’ I answered.</p>

<p>‘Then, all I’ve got to say is this: It was impossible for
anyone to have left the room and committed the crime
without my being aware of it. I say again, it would
have been impossible. She couldn’t have been out of the
room two minutes before she was struck. You see, she
had even been unable to get up the stair. Her going out
was quite unpremeditated; and until she jumped up from
her seat, and said she would go and look for Balfour,
nobody knew she was going out of the room. No, Mr.
Brodie, I’m convinced that no man of that company did
the deed.’</p>

<p>I had every reason to think that Captain Jarvis was
perfectly right in his conclusions. The logic of his argument
was unanswerable. I had already taken means to
ascertain some particulars about every person who had
been present on the fateful night, including the extra
servants; and I saw nothing and heard nothing calculated
in any way to justify a suspicion being entertained against
any particular individual. Nevertheless, I had them under
surveillance.</p>

<p>What I had to deal with was the broad, plain, hard
fact that Maggie Stiven had been brutally and suddenly
murdered, while Raymond Balfour had disappeared as
effectually as if the earth had suddenly opened and
swallowed him, leaving not a trace behind. If he went
forth from the house after quitting his guests, where had
he gone to?</p>

<p>The state of the country, owing to the snow, made
it physically impossible that he could have travelled far on
that awful night; and had he perished in the snow near
the house, his body must have been discovered, so thorough
had been our search.</p>

<p>Then, again, assuming that he had got away, there
would surely have been some indication of his mode of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
exit—an unfastened window, an unlocked door. But the
most exhaustive inquiry satisfied me there was neither one
nor the other.</p>

<p>But if Balfour was not out of the house, he must be in
the house; and if he was in the house, it was as a dead
man. And where was his body?</p>

<p>It seemed unreasonable to suppose that a human body
could be disposed of so quickly and so effectually as to
leave not a trace behind.</p>

<p>Then, again, granting that he was murdered, who murdered
him, and why was he murdered? Who raised the
unearthly cry, and was it raised purposely to draw him
from the room in order that he might be immediately
struck down?</p>

<p>Such was the problem with which I was confronted, and
I freely confess that at this stage I felt absolutely baffled.
I saw no clue, and nothing likely to lead me to a clue; but
though baffled, I was not beaten. The mystery was profound,
and the whole case so strange, so startling, that I
was not surprised at ignorant people attributing it to
supernatural agency. It had about it all the elements of
some wild, weird story of monkish superstition, lifted from
the pages of a mediæval romance. It was no romance,
however, no legend, but a hard, dry fact of the nineteenth
century that had to be accounted for by perfectly human
means.</p>

<p>There was one point, however, which made itself clear
through the darkness. It was that the author of the deed
was a person of such devilish cunning, such brutal ferocity,
such crafty ingenuity, that he would occupy a niche all to
himself for evermore in the gallery of criminals.</p>

<p>As I have already said, though I was baffled, I was
not beaten, and I felt sure I should ultimately succeed in
the task set me. I had in my possession the broken blade
of the stiletto, and I knew that might prove of value as a
clue; and having done all that it was practical to do for
the moment, I set to work to define a motive for the crime,
and to construct a theory that would aid me in my efforts
to solve the problem.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />


<small>THE DEAD HAND SMITES.</small></h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter Brodie</span> stood very high in his profession. He had
made his mark as a detective, and had solved some very
complicated problems. In recalling him from Liverpool,
whither he had been sent on important business, the
authorities felt that if the Corbie Hall mystery was to be
cleared up he was the man to do it. They saw from the
first that it was a very difficult case, when all the circumstances
were considered, but they were sure that Brodie
was the one man likely to tackle it successfully.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the evil reputation of Corbie Hall was
never to pass away, and after this new tragedy people
recalled how Peter Crease, the drunken owner of it, and
uncle of Balfour, had broken his neck in a quarry; how,
following that, the gloomy house had fallen into dilapidation,
until it was shunned as a haunted place. When the
rightful heir turned up, they thought he would put things
right; but instead of that he proved himself to be as big a
reprobate as his relative had been: and now his mysterious
disappearance, and Maggie Stiven’s murder, realized the
croakings of the wiseacres, who had said that a curse hung
over the house, and that anyone who went to live in the
Hall would come to grief.</p>

<p>Of course, the tradition that a favourite of Queen Mary’s
who had once lived there mysteriously disappeared, and
was never heard of again, was also recalled; and the sages
predicted that as that mystery was never cleared up, so
would Balfour’s disappearance go down to posterity as an
unsolved mystery. Possibly it might have done if Peter
Brodie had not brought his intellect to bear upon it.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after his arrival the thaw had been
so thorough that the land was quite clear of snow, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
a second search was made for Balfour, but it only ended in
failure, as the first had done.</p>

<p>Brodie was now convinced that the unfortunate man had
never left the house; and yet, having regard to the critical
way in which it had been examined from top to bottom, it
was difficult to conceive where he could be hidden. Nevertheless,
Peter stuck to his guns; for as Balfour had not
gone out of the house, he must be in it, and if so, time and
patient search might reveal his hiding-place.</p>

<p>With a view to learning as much as possible about
Balfour’s habits, Brodie had a long talk with Chunda,
Captain Jarvis acting as interpreter. The native stated
that he had travelled with his master extensively through
India. He had found him rather a peculiar man. He was
very secretive, and given to fits of moodiness. Although
Chunda was exceedingly fond of him, he did not wish to
accompany him to Scotland, but yielded on the master
pressing him. Now he bitterly regretted having come, for
not only did he feel crushed by his master’s strange disappearance,
but the cold and dampness of the climate
made him very ill, and he intended to leave immediately
for Southampton, so as to get a ship for India, as he
yearned to return to his own warm, sunny land. He was
dying for the want of sun and warmth.</p>

<p>Asked if his master was much given to flirtations,
Chunda, with flashing eyes and an angry expression in his
dark face, said that he was, and he had frequently got into
trouble through it.</p>

<p>After this interview, Brodie came to the conclusion that
the motive of the crime was undoubtedly jealousy. That
is to say, someone had been jealous of Balfour, someone
who considered Maggie a rival.</p>

<p>If this was correct, the someone must be a woman—no
ordinary woman, for no ordinary woman would have been
capable of carrying out such a terrible revenge. Besides
Maggie Stiven, there had been four other young women in
the party.</p>

<p>One was a married woman named MacLauchlan. Her
husband kept a grocer’s shop in the High Street, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
and his wife didn’t get on well together. He had no idea,
however, that she was in the habit of visiting at Corbie
Hall.</p>

<p>Brodie dismissed her from suspicion. He felt sure she
didn’t commit the deed. She was rather good-looking,
but a mild, lackadaisical, phlegmatic, brainless creature,
without the nerve necessary for such a crime.</p>

<p>Another of the ladies was Jean Smith. She was twenty
years of age, and Maggie Stiven’s bosom friend, and since
the night of the crime had been seriously ill in bed from
the shock.</p>

<p>A third was Mary Johnstone. Until New Year’s Eve
she had never met Balfour before in her life. She had
gone to the Hall in company with her sweetheart, James
Macfarlane, the medical student.</p>

<p>The fourth was Kate Thomson, cousin to Rab Thomson.
She was a woman about thirty years of age, strong and
well knit, but was a good-tempered, genial sort of creature.
She, too, was almost a stranger to Balfour, and was
engaged to be married to a man named Robert Murchison,
who was factor to a Mr. Rennie of Perth.</p>

<p>Brodie was absolutely certain, after studying them all,
that not one of these four women had done the deed.
Nor was there the slightest reason for harbouring a
suspicion against the female servants.</p>

<p>He was, therefore, puzzled, but not disconcerted, and he
stuck to his theory that a jealous woman had committed
the crime.</p>

<p>That, of course, only made the mystery more mysterious,
so to speak. For who was the woman? Where did she
come from? How did she get into the house? Where
did she go to?</p>

<p>These questions were inevitable if the theory was maintained.
It did not seem easy then to answer them.</p>

<p>As Brodie revolved all these things in his mind, he
remembered that, though he had subjected the house to a
very careful search, he had done little more than look into
Chunda’s room, the reason being that the native was ill in
bed at the time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>The room adjoined Balfour’s, and at one time was connected
by a communicating door, but for some reason or
other the door had been nailed up and papered over.
While less in size than Balfour’s, it was still a fairly large
room, also wainscoted, and with a carved wooden ceiling.
It was lighted by one window, which commanded a good
view over Blackford Hill.</p>

<p>To this room Brodie went one evening when Chunda
happened to be absent from it. It reeked with the faint,
sickly odour of some Indian perfume.</p>

<p>On a sideboard stood a small gilt Indian idol, and
various Indian knick-knacks were scattered about. As in
Balfour’s room, there was a massive carved oak mantelpiece,
with a very capacious fireplace; and on each side of
the fireplace was a deep recess.</p>

<p>The floor was oak, polished, and dark in colour either
by staining or time. The only carpet on it was a square
in the centre. A clothes-press stood in a corner. It was
the only place in which a man could be concealed. Brodie
opened the door, and found nothing but clothes there.
The mystery, therefore, was as far from solution as ever,
apparently, as now there wasn’t a corner of the house that
had not been examined thoroughly and exhaustively.</p>

<p>As Brodie was in the act of leaving the room, his eye
was attracted by something glittering on the hearthstone,
where the cold, white ashes of a wood-fire still remained. He
stooped down and picked from the hearth a scrap, a mere
morsel of cloth. It was all burnt round the edges, and
was dusty with the ash; but he found on examination
that it was a fragment of Indian cloth, into which gold
threads had been worked; and it was these gold threads
which, in spite of the dust, had reflected the light and
attracted his notice.</p>

<p>Taking out his pocket-book, he deposited that scrap of
charred cloth carefully between the leaves, then went
down on his knees and subjected the ashes to critical
examination, with the result that he obtained unmistakable
evidence of a considerable amount of cloth having been destroyed
by fire. There were patches here and there of white,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
or rather gray, carbonized, filmy fragments of cobweb-like
texture. As everyone knows, cloth burnt in a fire leaves
a ghost-like wrack behind, that, unless disturbed, will remain
for some time.</p>

<p>Brodie rose and fell into deep thought, and he mentally
asked himself why the cloth had been burnt. It was
reasonable to presume it was some portion of clothing,
and if so, why should anyone have been at the trouble
to consume it in the flames unless it was to hide certain
evidences of guilt.</p>

<p>‘What would those evidences of guilt be?’ Brodie
muttered to himself, as he reflected on the singular discovery
he had made. And suddenly it seemed to him—of
course, it was purely fancy—that a voice whispered in
his ear:</p>

<p>‘Blood! blood!’</p>

<p>Although but fancy, the voice seemed so real to him
that he fairly started, and at that instant the door opened
and Chunda entered. He seemed greatly surprised to
find the detective in the room, and muttered something
in Hindustani.</p>

<p>As Brodie did not understand him and could not converse
with him, he made no response, but passed out,
and, hurrying to Edinburgh, called on Professor Dunbar,
the eminent microscopist, and asked that gentleman to
place the fragment of cloth found on the hearthstone
under a powerful microscope.</p>

<p>The Professor did as requested, and, after a careful
examination, he said he could not detect anything suggestive
of blood. The cloth was evidently of Indian
workmanship, and the bright threads running through it
were real gold.</p>

<p>Brodie did not return to Corbie Hall until the following
day. By that time Maggie Stiven’s body had been
removed by her friends for burial, and he was informed
by the servants that Chunda had gone out to attend the
funeral. He was rather surprised at that, and still more
surprised when he found, on going to Chunda’s room, that
the door was locked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>He hurried back to Edinburgh, and was in time to be
present at Maggie’s burial in the Greyfriars Churchyard,
but he saw nothing of Chunda; the native was not there,
and nobody had seen him. Captain Jarvis was amongst
the mourners, and when the funeral was over he and
Brodie left together.</p>

<p>‘Do you know how long Chunda has been in Balfour’s
service?’ the detective asked, as they strolled along.</p>

<p>‘I believe a considerable time, but I don’t know from
absolute knowledge. As I have already told you, Balfour
was a curious sort of fellow, and particularly close in
regard to his own affairs. He was one of those sort of
men it is difficult to get to the bottom of. You may
try to probe them as much as you like, but nothing comes
of it.’</p>

<p>‘You possibly were as familiar with him as anyone,’
suggested Brodie.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I should say I was.’</p>

<p>‘And if he had wanted a confidant, he would probably
have chosen you?’</p>

<p>‘I think it is very likely he would. So far as such
a man would make a confidant of anyone, he made one
of me.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know why he brought Chunda from India
with him?’</p>

<p>‘No. What I do know is this: Chunda had been with
him for some time, and when Balfour returned to Scotland,
he thought he was only going to make a temporary
stay here.’</p>

<p>‘Was he fond of Chunda?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot tell you whether he was or was not.’</p>

<p>‘Can you tell me this: Has Chunda been in the habit
of always wearing European clothes since he came to
Edinburgh?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know that. You see, I only came into port
with my vessel four weeks ago. When I first called at
Corbie Hall, the fellow was wearing European clothes.’</p>

<p>‘Did you see much of Chunda on New Year’s Eve?’</p>

<p>‘He came into the room now and again. In fact, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
think he was in and out pretty often. Balfour used
occasionally to smoke an opium pipe, and Chunda always
filled it for him.’</p>

<p>‘How was the native dressed that night?’</p>

<p>‘He had trousers and vest, and wore a sort of fancy
Indian jacket.’</p>

<p>‘Was there gold embroidery on it?’</p>

<p>‘I believe there was a sort of gold thread, or something
of that kind. But, really, I didn’t take much notice. We
were all pretty jolly, and I didn’t look to see how anyone
was dressed.’</p>

<p>‘But, still, you have no doubt that Chunda did wear
a jacket or robe similar to that you describe?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, I’m sure about that part of the business. It
was conspicuous enough.’</p>

<p>When Brodie parted from the skipper, he felt that
he had struck a trail, although he could not make much
of it just then. But it will readily be gathered that he
had begun to suspect Chunda of having committed the
crime.</p>

<p>It was difficult to understand why Chunda should have
burnt his gown or jacket unless it was to destroy traces of
guilt. If there was blood on his jacket, and it was the
blood of one of the victims, he would know that it might
prove a ghastly piece of evidence if detected; and so he
had committed it to the flames as the most effectual means
of getting rid of it.</p>

<p>Now, assuming this surmise of Brodie’s was correct, it
was obvious that it was not Maggie Stiven’s blood, because
the nature of the wound that brought about her death was
such that there was only very little outward bleeding.
But if Balfour, when he went upstairs to ascertain the
cause of the scream, was suddenly attacked and stabbed to
death by the native, was it not reasonable to suppose that
he bled so profusely as to dye the garments of his
murderer?</p>

<p>This chain of reasoning threw a new light on the affair,
and Brodie, who had made up his mind that he would read
the riddle if it could be read, returned once more to Corbie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
Hall. He learnt that Chunda had been back about half
an hour, and had given the other servants to understand
that he was ill and half frozen, and was going to bed.
Whereupon the detective furnished himself with a lamp,
and proceeded to carefully examine the stair carpet and
the landings for suggestive stains, but saw nothing that
aroused his suspicions. As he could not talk to Chunda,
he did not disturb him, but the next morning, quite
early, he went down to the Hall again in company with
Jarvis.</p>

<p>Chunda told the skipper, in answer to questions put to
him, that he had not gone out on the previous day to
attend the funeral, as stated, but to make arrangements
for taking his departure from the country. He could not
endure the climate; it made him very ill. Besides that,
he felt that he would go mad if he stayed there, for there
wasn’t a soul he could talk to, and his loneliness was
terrible. He therefore intended to start on the following
day for Southampton, and two days later would sail in a
P. and O. steamer for India.</p>

<p>All that he had said seemed very feasible, and that he
was ill and did suffer from the cold was evident.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Brodie’s suspicions were not allayed. It
was not easy to allay them when once they were thoroughly
aroused; and having reasoned the case out from every
possible point of view, he had come to the conclusion that
Chunda was in a position to let in light where there was
now darkness if he chose to speak. That is to say, he
knew something of the crime, though, of course, at this
stage there wasn’t a scrap of evidence against the native
that would have justified his arrest. Moreover, Brodie
found himself confronted with a huge difficulty in the way
of making his theory fit in. If Chunda had really murdered
Balfour, how had he managed to dispose of the
body? That question was certainly a poser, and no
reasonable answer could be given to it.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that, from the moment of the
scream being first heard to the discovery of Maggie
Stiven’s body on the mat at the foot of the stairs, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
more than half an hour at the outside had elapsed. In
that brief space of time Balfour had been so effectually got
rid of that there was not a trace of him. It was bewildering
to try and understand how that disappearance had
been accomplished, unless it was with the aid of some
devilish art and unholy magic. But as Brodie had no
belief in that kind of thing, he was convinced that, sooner
or later, what was then an impenetrable mystery would be
explained by perfectly rational, though probably startling,
causes. Be that as it might, having got his fangs fixed,
to use a figure of speech, he held on with bulldog tenacity,
and he was not disposed to exonerate Chunda until he felt
convinced that his suspicions were unfounded.</p>

<p>‘Do you know, captain, if there are any balls of any
kind in the house?’ he asked abruptly of Jarvis, who
looked at him with some astonishment, for the question
seemed so irrelevant and out of place.</p>

<p>‘What sort of balls?’ said Jarvis, expressing his surprise
by his manner and voice.</p>

<p>‘Oh, any sort—billiard-balls, golf-balls, balls of any
kind.’</p>

<p>‘There are plenty of golf-balls. But why do you ask?’</p>

<p>‘I want you to get two or three of the balls,’ said
Brodie for answer. ‘Put them into your pocket, ask
Chunda to accompany you into the dining-room, and
make him sit down in a chair opposite to you. Engage
him in conversation for a few minutes; then, suddenly
taking the balls from your pocket, tell him to catch them,
and pitch them to him. Do you understand me?’</p>

<p>Captain Jarvis stared at the detective as though he
could hardly believe the evidence of his ears. Then, as he
broke into a laugh, he asked:</p>

<p>‘Do you mean that seriously?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I mean it.’</p>

<p>‘And what’s the object?’</p>

<p>‘Never mind the object. Do what I ask you.’</p>

<p>‘And where will you be?’</p>

<p>‘In the dining-room, too. But take no notice whatever
of me.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>‘Well, it’s a daft-like sort of proceeding, any way; but
I’ll do it.’</p>

<p>Then, having procured some golf-balls, he addressed
himself to Chunda in Hindustani, and in a few moments
they went together into the dining-room.</p>

<p>Brodie followed shortly after, and, taking a book from
a little shelf that hung on the wall, he threw himself on to
a lounge and appeared to be reading.</p>

<p>In a short while Jarvis took the balls from his pocket,
and, saying something to Chunda, who sat on a chair by
the window, he threw one ball after another at him, and
the native held forth his hands to catch them; but, not
being in a playful humour, he did not cast the balls back,
but very soon got up and went out, looking very much
annoyed.</p>

<p>‘Well, what does that tomfoolery mean?’ asked Jarvis.</p>

<p>‘A good deal to me. I’ve learnt a startling fact by it.’</p>

<p>The skipper would have been glad to have had an
explanation, for naturally his curiosity was greatly aroused,
and he couldn’t conceive what the ball-throwing could
possibly have indicated. But Brodie resolutely refused to
satisfy him.</p>

<p>‘You have rendered me a service,’ he said. ‘Now, that’s
enough for the present. If I succeed in fitting the pieces
of this strange puzzle together, you shall know what my
motive was. Rest assured I do nothing without a motive.
But I am going to exact a further service from you now.
I want you to stay here all night, as I myself intend to
stay. Chunda talked of leaving to-morrow. He must not
leave, and, if necessary, you must find some means of
detaining him.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to say you suspect Chunda of having
committed the crime?’—his amazement growing.</p>

<p>‘Frankly, I do.’</p>

<p>‘Well, all I’ve got to say, Brodie, is this,’ answered the
skipper decisively: ‘you are on the wrong tack.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know I am?’</p>

<p>‘I am sure of it.’</p>

<p>‘Give me your reasons for being sure.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>‘Why, I tell you, man,’ exclaimed the skipper warmly,
‘the nigger is as harmless as a kitten, and no more likely
to commit a crime of this kind than a new-born baby.’</p>

<p>‘That is simply your opinion, Captain Jarvis.’</p>

<p>‘It is my opinion, and it’s a common-sense one. You
are doing the fellow a wrong. I never saw a native servant
so attached to Balfour as Chunda was to his master. I
tell you, Brodie, you are on the wrong scent.’</p>

<p>‘All right, we shall see,’ he said carelessly.</p>

<p>‘But in the name of common-sense,’ cried Jarvis, who
was argumentatively inclined, ‘if there’s any reason in
your suspicions, how on earth do you suppose this nigger
chap got rid of Balfour? Where has he stowed him, do
you think? Do you suppose he swallowed him?’</p>

<p>‘Ah! an answer to that question is not easily framed.
Perhaps before many hours have passed I may be able to
tell you.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think because he’s black he’s the devil, and has
spirited Balfour away?’ pursued the skipper, with a defiant
air, for he honestly considered that Chunda was being
wronged, and he was ready to champion him.</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t think so,’ answered Brodie, with a smile,
‘because if he had been the devil he wouldn’t have committed
such a clumsy crime as this.’</p>

<p>‘Well, clumsy as it is, it’s defied you,’ said Jarvis, by no
means satisfied or convinced.</p>

<p>‘For the time being it has. But it won’t continue to do
so much longer, unless I’m very much mistaken. But it’s
no use continuing the argument. A man is judged by his
acts, not by his words. If I am wrong, I must abide by
the penalty which attaches to failure. If I am right, I
shall take credit for some amount of cleverness. You will
stay here to-night, won’t you?’</p>

<p>The skipper scratched his head, and looked as though
he wasn’t comfortable.</p>

<p>‘Well, upon my word! I don’t know what to say. I’m
not a coward, but I’m blowed if I like the idea of passing
another night in this uncanny place.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’ Brodie asked with a smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>‘I should be afraid of seeing Maggie Stiven’s ghost.’</p>

<p>‘And what if you did? A ghost couldn’t do you any
harm.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not, but I’d rather not see one.’</p>

<p>‘Nor are you likely to, except as a product of your
own heated imagination. However, to cut the matter
short, you’ll stay, won’t you? You’ve got your pipe and
tobacco, and I’ve no doubt the cook will be able to provide
us with some creature comforts. We’ll have another
log put on the fire, and make ourselves comfortable; and,
if you like, I’ll give you a hand at cribbage.’</p>

<p>The skipper yielded, and the matter was settled.</p>

<p>‘Before we settle down, I want you to entertain Chunda
here for half an hour during my absence,’ continued
Brodie.</p>

<p>‘You are not going out, are you?’ asked Jarvis
quickly, and with some nervousness displaying itself in his
manner, indicating evidently that he did not wish to be
left alone.</p>

<p>‘Well, no, not out of the house. But you understand,
Captain Jarvis, I am doing my best to unravel this
mystery; you must let me act in my own way, and take
such steps as I think are necessary to the end I have in
view. You can aid me, and I want you to aid me; but
you can best do that by refraining from questioning, and
in doing exactly as I request you to do.’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ said Jarvis. ‘I’ve nothing more to say.
You must sail your own ship, whether you come to grief
or whether you don’t.’</p>

<p>‘Precisely. Now, I’ll send one of the servants up for
Chunda, and you’ll keep him engaged in talk for half
an hour, or until I come back into the room. Don’t
talk about the crime, and don’t say a word that would
lead him to think I suspect him. Do you understand
me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, of course I do.’</p>

<p>‘And will carry out my wishes? It is most important
that you should.’</p>

<p>‘To the letter.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>The business being thus arranged, Brodie left the room,
and ten minutes later Chunda entered it. Brodie was
absent nearly three-quarters of an hour before he returned.
There was a look of peculiar satisfaction on his face.
Chunda was dismissed; and the two men, having, through
the cook, secured something in the way of eatables and
drinkables, satisfied their wants in that respect, and then
engaged in cribbage, and continued their game until a late
hour.</p>

<p>At last Jarvis retired. It was arranged he was to sleep
in Balfour’s bedroom, but Brodie said he would stow
himself on a couch in the dining-room, which was warm
and comfortable.</p>

<p>He dozed for three or four hours, and exactly at five
rose, and made his way to the stable-yard, where, according
to prearrangement, the groom was ready with a horse and
trap, and Brodie drove rapidly into Edinburgh. He was
back again soon after eight, with two constables in plain
clothes, who were for the time confined to the kitchen,
until their services might be required.</p>

<p>Jarvis did not rise until after nine. He was a good and
sound sleeper, and neither ghosts nor anything else had
disturbed him. He was kept in ignorance of Brodie’s
journey into Edinburgh.</p>

<p>A few minutes before ten Chunda made his appearance.
He was ready to start, and he enlisted the aid of the other
servants to bring his luggage down into the hall. Again
Brodie requested the skipper to detain the native in
conversation, while he himself went upstairs to Chunda’s
room, where he shut himself in and locked the door.
Then he began to tap with his knuckles the wainscoted
walls, going from panel to panel.</p>

<p>When he reached the deep recess near the fireplace,
already described, he started, as his taps produced a
hollow sound. He tapped again and again, putting his
ear to the woodwork. There was no mistake about it.
The wall there was hollow. He tried to move the hollow
panel, but only after many trials and much examination
did he succeed. The panel slid on one side, revealing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
dark abyss, from which came a strange, cold, earthy,
clammy smell.</p>

<p>He closed the panel, went downstairs, and told the
constables the time for action had come. They filed into
the dining-room, and Jarvis was asked to tell Chunda that
he would be arrested on a charge of having murdered
Raymond Balfour and Maggie Stiven.</p>

<p>If it is possible for a black person to turn pale, then
Chunda did so. Any way, the announcement was like an
electric shock to him. He staggered; then clapped his
hands to his face, and moaned and whined.</p>

<p>Brodie went upstairs once more—this time in company
with one of the constables. They were provided with
lanterns, and when the panel in Chunda’s room was opened
again, the light revealed a narrow flight of stone steps
descending between the walls; and at the bottom of the
steps lay something huddled up. It was unmistakably
a human body, the body of Raymond Balfour.</p>

<p>Chunda was at once conveyed to Edinburgh, and other
men were sent out from the town to the house. Then the
decomposed body was got up. It was Balfour, sure
enough. He had been stabbed in the chest, and the heart
had been pierced through.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the stone steps there was also found
the other portion of the long stiletto.</p>

<p>All this, however, was not proof that Chunda had done
the deed. But there was something else that was.</p>

<p>The dead man’s right hand was tightly clenched, and when
it was opened by the doctor who was called in to examine
the remains, a piece of cloth was released from the death
grip. It was a piece of Indian cloth, interwoven with gold
threads, and identical with the scrap that Brodie had
found in the ashes.</p>

<p>The dead hand afforded the necessary clue; it forged
the last link. The dead hand smote the destroyer. It
proved beyond doubt that Chunda was the murderer. He
had by some means discovered the secret panel. He had
inveigled Balfour into the room. There he had stabbed
him. In his dying agony the wretched man had clutched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
at his murderer, and had torn out a piece of the gold-threaded
jacket he was wearing. That jacket must have
been deeply stained with blood, and Chunda had cast
it upon the fire. But murder will out, and the unconsumed
fragment gave the sharp-eyed Brodie the <span class="allsmcap">FIRST</span> clue.
The dead hand itself of the murdered man afforded the
<span class="allsmcap">LAST</span>.</p>

<p>Chunda was the murderer, or, rather, the murderess; for
Chunda was a woman. Brodie had begun to suspect this
from a peculiarity of voice, from the formation of her neck
and shoulders, and from other signs, and his suspicions
were confirmed when he resorted to the ball test.</p>

<p>When the balls were thrown, Chunda did not, as a man
would have done, close his knees, but spread them open.
A woman invariably does this when she is in a sitting
posture and anything is thrown at her lap.</p>

<p>Chunda subsequently proved to be a woman, sure
enough, and the murder was the result—as Brodie had also
correctly divined—of jealousy.</p>

<p>The wretched creature succeeded in strangling herself
before she was brought to trial, and she left behind her a
paper written in excellent English, in which she confessed
the crime. She declared that she was the wife of Balfour,
who had espoused her in India. She represented a very
old and high-caste family. Her father was a Rajah, and
Balfour had been in his employ. He succeeded in winning
her affections, and when he returned to his own country
she determined to accompany him. He treated her very
badly, and twice he attempted to poison her. His flirtation
with Maggie Stiven excited her to madness, but it
was, nevertheless, a very cunning madness. She had previously
discovered by chance the sliding panel and the
secret stairs.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Eve she opened the panel, went to the
top of the stairs, and uttered that eerie screech or scream
that had so alarmed the company. She felt sure it would
bring her husband to her. She told him that she had
received a horrible fright in her room; that part of the
wall had opened, revealing a dark abyss, from which strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
noises issued. As soon as he was in the room she stabbed
him with a long Indian stiletto. It then suddenly struck
her that, when he didn’t return, it was very likely Maggie
Stiven would go in search of him. So she hurried down
the stairs and hid underneath them, and as soon as Maggie
appeared she sprang upon her and stabbed her with such
fury that the blade of the dagger broke.</p>

<p>Although her husband had treated her so badly, she had
yielded to his earnest entreaties to conceal her identity and
continue to pass as a man. She spoke and wrote English
fluently, although he had made her promise not to let this
fact be known.</p>

<p>Such was the story she told, and there was no doubt it
was substantially correct. She considered that she had
managed the crime so well that suspicion would never rest
upon her, and, having carried out her deed of awful
vengeance, she would be able to return to her own sun-scorched
land.</p>

<p>That she would have succeeded in this was likely enough
had Peter Brodie not been brought upon the scene. He had
worked out the problem line by line, and at last, when it
struck him that if Balfour was murdered he must have
been murdered in Chunda’s room, he proceeded to examine
the floor carefully on the night when he asked Jarvis to
keep Chunda in conversation for half an hour. That
examination revealed unmistakable traces of blood on the
boards. Then it occurred to him that, as the house was
an old one, it was more than likely there was some secret
closet or recess in which the body had been hidden.</p>

<p>Chunda had evidently been well educated. In a postscript
to her confession she said that, out of the great love
she bore the man who had so cruelly deceived her, she
had, at his suggestion, consented to pass herself off as his
servant. He had assured her that it would only be for a
short time, and that when he had his affairs settled, and
sold his property, he would go back with her to India,
and they would live in regal splendour to the end of their
days.</p>

<p>That she loved him was pretty certain. That he shamefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
deceived her was no less certain; and that love of
hers, and that deception, afforded some palliation for her
bloodthirsty deed of vengeance.</p>

<p>For some time after the double crime Corbie Hall
remained desolate and lonely. It was now looked upon
as a doubly-accursed place, and nobody could be found
who would take it, so at last it was razed to the ground,
and is known no more.</p>

<p>In pulling it down it was discovered that in Balfour’s
room was a secret panel corresponding to the one in the
next room, and that the stone stairs had at one time led
to a subterraneous passage, which had an opening somewhere
in Blackford Glen. It had no doubt originally
been constructed to afford the inmates of the house means
of escape in the stormy times when the building was first
reared.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> This was quite true. The contingency of war was even less
remote than the Prince’s words suggested. As a matter of fact, it
is now well known that the treaty had been formed between Russia
and another country against Turkey, and had Turkey become aware
of it, there is little doubt she would have flown at Russia’s throat,
with results less disastrous to herself than those which befell her at
a later period, when the legions of Russia crossed the Pruth, and
commenced that sanguinary struggle which entailed such enormous
loss of life, the expenditure of thousands of millions of money,
and human agony and suffering beyond the power of words to
describe.</p>
